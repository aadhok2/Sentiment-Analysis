0,1,train,"This film is a spicy little piece of film-making from Sam Fuller which gives Richard Widmark the chance to show of some of his best , most edgy acting in the role of Skip McCoy , a small-time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful Candy 's ( Jean Peters ) pocket on a crowded bus . It turns out Candy was doing a favor for her ( ex ? ) boyfriend , who 's working for the `` commies '' . Superficially , there 's a mystery here regarding Candy 's motives and Skip spends much of the film determining her motives . Actually he seems to just initially assume that she 's a `` commie '' , going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture . But the real question is  what 's going on with Skip ? What are his motives , and why does Candy like him so much ? Why do we ( the audience ) want to like him so much ? Basically what the film-makers have done here is create a very striking `` male fatale '' in Widmark 's character and his performance . Just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like `` The Big Sleep '' or `` The Glass Key '' along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face , the film-makers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers . Widmark is handsome , and there 's also a charm in his boyish insouciance  but the first two times he meets our leading lady , he robs her and then punches her in the face . Eventually the question becomes  would Skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck ( his comments to the police , like `` you 're waving a flag at ME ? '' make us suspect he would ) or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend Moe ( Thelma Ritter ) ? I 'm not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way . Thelma Ritter 's character work deserves special mention  she has created a truly indelible character here . Fuller is n't afraid to give her plenty of `` business ''  in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world , particularly her used ties . Another example of Fuller 's `` business '' would be the scene with Victor Perry ( an actor I 've seen elsewhere used to less effect ) using the chopsticks to intimidate Candy . The emphasis on Moe 's relationship with Skip provides one of cinema 's most revealing `` honor among thieves '' themes . In fact Skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police , with the notable exception of Capt . Tiger ( Murvyn Vye ) who has a grudge against him . I loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack . Those are the kind of details that make this film feel real  whether or not it really is `` realistic '' or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions . All told , I would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the `` film noir '' school of film-making . A predictable plot is off-set by a host of colorful characters ( uniformly well-performed ) , cheap sets are disguised by the film 's unrelenting pace , and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is . This is the best film I 've seen so far by Sam Fuller and helps me to see better why he 's regarded as a master director  here he accomplished some things that I think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like `` The Crimson Kimono '' and `` Shock Corridor '' as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense . This is one of my favorite performances from Widmark that I 've seen so far  and Widmark was a talent that I 'm tempted to say ( based on the few extraordinary films I 've seen with him ) was comparable to that of Alan Ladd or Humphrey Bogart , although arguably he did n't make as many classic films ."
1,1,train,"I enjoyed this movie , and after watching it , it made me wonder just how many 'Caitlin Rose 's ' exist in the world.How many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse , and torment by classmates and have been too frightened to open their mouth about it ? Just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another , because as this film demonstrates , who 's right is not foremost important , its who is popular , and feared which manipulates the minds of youths , and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen.Tiffani Amber Thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim , and Brian Austin Green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved , and his best friend.This is the kind of film that does n't get the exposure it deserves.Remarkable , and brilliant , too good to be just a film made for TV ."

3,1,train,"When people nowadays hear of a 1940s drama , they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it 's another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic , melancholic roles . This opinion , however , does not resemble Neorealist movies , in particular this one directed by Count Luchino Visconti . OSSESSIONE as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others . The contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these 65 years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself , exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past . At the same time , while being based on the novel by James M. Cain , THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE , it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style , view , his own art . I have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which I 'd like to entail below . First , Visconti 's movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life , in particular those absorbed by desire . These people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face . Gino ( Massimo Girotti ) a traveler with `` bear like shoulders '' turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near Ferrara and enters the tavern . Although many people go there to have a meal , Gino occurs to get something more - much more : the indefatigable desire of beautiful Giovanna ( Clara Calamai ) a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar , Mr Giuseppe Bragana ( Juan De Landa ) . Her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love , the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together ... However , are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire ? Can one build love upon murder ? What is love and what is loyalty ? Does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession ? Such questions intensely arise while watching the movie , when , to the core , the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters . `` We have to love each other affectionately '' answers Giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything ? `` Is n't it what we both wanted '' says one of the couple ... it occurs that it 's not . Therefore , the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart . Yet , it constantly remains thought provoking . Second , OSSESSIONE has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers : brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography , which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power . These make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost 70 years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch . They range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots . Who can possibly skip that moment in Ferrara where Gino meets a beautiful girl , a sort of `` Ragazza Perfetta '' ( perfect girl ) , a dancer Anita and buys her ice cream . His desires show him totally different direction ... Do viewers remain indifferent at Gino-Giovanna 's first meeting ? The first focus of camera is on Giovanna 's legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that Gino experiences . A marvel of shot is Gino and Giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look . Third , OSSESSIONE can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast . Massimo Girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done ; yet , consequently , what comes out is a flawless acting . He portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but can not stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim , which represents conscience . His bisexuality is indicated through the character of Lo Spagnolo ( Elio Marcuzzo ) whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for Ancona . Clara Calamai , who was cast in the role after eminent Anna Magnani had refused , fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple . They are both very convincing . Besides , I liked Juan De Langa in the role of Bragana : he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art . In some of his most witty moments , he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance . In sum , we , as modern viewers who are capable of critical view , have to look at this film very objectively . It is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned , it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries ; yet , is it educational ? Visconti was not Fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity . In such case , his films would only entertain ( which is , of course , not entirely Fellini 's style , too ) . Visconti always had something to convey . What did he want to say here ? Is the film against bad marriage ? Or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire ? The final shocking moments say for themselves . Though you do n't have to agree with the vision , OSSESSIONE is really a wonderfully realistic film , one of Visconti 's best 8/10"
4,1,train,"Guys and Dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever . It is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more . it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals-musicals were made to entertain , not to to preach . Nowadays we have Rent and Chicago which are great musicals and good movies but they fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached . The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando , the guy ca n't sing ! It was very annoying to listen to him sing and talk when I could n't understand him . If it were n't for Marlon I would have given this 10 stars . Guys and Dolls provides old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days . Watch it to have a good time ! !"
5,1,train,"It 's a strange , yet somehow impressive story , about love . Personnaly , I never run over such a twist-off story in real life . But , I can image there is . It 's a story that promises to be `` sick '' from the title . But , after I watch it , I did n't get this feeling of `` sickness '' which I would surely have regarding society rules . It 's something beautiful in this movie ... something impressive ... which I can not contradict using any moral or society rules . The movie focuses mostly on relation between Kiki and Alex . You can see how this relation starts , evolves and finally ends . You feel the moment when this love blossoms , the first whispers , touchings . You feel the connection . And no moment I though this is immoral . You even hope it will not break in the end ... .it can not break ... it 's not right . You feel the pain of being hart broken in the end ... But , I need also to add a negative spin to this comment ... I do n't know if the story is not somehow *showed* to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form , but not in content . You do n't have the total story , but only fragments . When movie has started , the relation between Kiki and Sandu was already in place . So , no clue about the nature of the relation . You feel only a tension between them ... a fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation . I think this line of Kiki to Sandu says all : `` I want to stop ... and if you love me , you will do as I ask you '' . This movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral ... and where 's the limit between them . I do n't know if the idea of this movie is `` love conquers all ... even social and moral standards '' or `` love is beautiful ... no matter how or where '' . But in my opinion , this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think ..."

The film makes you care about each member of this fox family , from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic . Set against an inhospitable countryside , the audience 's hearts warm to the family members . The music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms .

If you 've never watched this show , you 're in for an extended treat . Yes , there is violence and nudity , but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast Tony Soprano , the thinking man 's gangster , with the reality of the life he has been born to and , quite frankly , would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up . Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist , then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage , and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew , take a break , sit down and watch TV while eating peanut butter out of the jar , and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a Sunday afternoon of viewing NFL football . Even Carmella , his wife , when given a chance for a way out , finds that she really prefers life with Tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own .

Too bad the whole film seems to move at about double the pace that would be appropriate - at least in the first act . One important aspect of any Disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - which Atlantis does n't provide . He 's average at best . Halfway through the movie there 's a mediocre twist . That 's all .

I first saw this film the year of it 's release around 1987 . My school organised a trip to the cinema to see it , for an RE project I think . We all went along of course excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema ! Little did we know what we were about to experience . To this day I still remember the feelings it invoked in me and i remembered crying a lot as were most of my friends . I think at the age we were we found it shocking and quiet rightly outraged in our own youthful way .It had such an impact on me that I joined the Anti Apartheid Movement the same year . I think it served it 's purpose in my case ."

11,1,train,"I 've just returned from a showing of `` My Left Foot '' at our public library . What an emotional experience -- I feel drained and uplifted . It 's the story of Christy Brown , Irish writer and painter , and based on the author 's autobiographical `` My Left Foot . '' Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy such that the only limb he had good control of was his left foot . Doctors advised his parents he was hopelessly mentally retarded but his mother did n't give up on him and , somewhat as Annie Sullivan had done with Helen Keller , helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet and then to read , write , and paint . This film won Academy Awards for Daniel Day-Lewis ( best actor ) as well as best supporting actress for the actress playing his mother ; it also received Oscar nominations for best picture , best director , and best adapted screenplay . As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist , while many films may entertain me , many also often leave me having to overlook gross fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological reactions . Not this film -- it was absolutely `` spot on '' in portraying typical Irish parental roles & behaviors ( see , e.g. , see typical Irish families in McGoldrick 's `` Ethnicity & Family Therapy '' ) as well Christy Brown 's uneven emotional maturation -- some immature personality reactions that were even further amplified by his picking up traits of his father . The film presents the greater truth while changing certain sequences in his development ( painting & writing ) and condensing several important people into one person , for the sake of telling a coherent , believable story , not burdened by small , distracting , less important actualities . ( See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more accuracy . ) The DVD version we were shown had some English subtitles that were a great help in understanding Christy 's speech ( & some of the Irish speech ) ; the initial release of the film may have lacked this . ( If you see this on DVD , enable that option . ) The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest , believable acting jobs I 've ever seen . Truly magnificent , outstanding , superlative . `` My Left Foot '' bears more than some similarity to a more recent film , `` The Diving Bell & the Butterfly , '' in that each portrays the life of a real person successfully surmounting the imprisonment and isolation of an extremely severe physical handicap . And in doing so , it resonates with William Ernest Henley 's `` Invictus '' which begins : `` Out of the night that covers me , //Black as the Pit from pole to pole , //I thank whatever gods may be//For my unconquerable soul .

This is entertainment , after all ! The plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies ( like Usual Suspects ) where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out . I wondered about Domino Harvey herself , how her life became of interest to Hollywood . As for the acting , lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers . And any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well . Not once did I think of Kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume . And granted , Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often , but here , despite the violence , he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people ."
13,1,train,"One of John Ford 's best films 'The Informer ' does n't feature any grand scenery of the American West . Instead the intense drama Ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged terrain of British character actor Victor McLaglen 's face . The former prizefighter , who once faced Joe Louis in the ring , delivers an Academy Award-winning portrayal of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life . The plot is gracefully simple : In 1922 Dublin , a starving and humiliated man who 's been thrown out of the IRA for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood , himself becomes an informant . For £20 he betrays a friend to `` the Tans '' and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt , denial , self-pity , and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions . It is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo that is the film 's most impressive achievement . In most movies a burly lout of Gypo 's type would be cast as the heavy , he 'd have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown . In 'The Informer ' Gypo himself is both hero and villain , while the showdown is in his inner turmoil , every bit of which is explicitly shared with the audience . Because Liam O'Flaherty 's novel had previously been filmed in 1929 , RKO gave Ford a very modest budget . The director and his associates , particularly cinematographer Joseph H. August , turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself . In addition to McLaglen 's Oscar 'The Informer ' also won John Ford his first along with wins for Best Screenplay and Best Score ."

15,1,train,"POSSIBLE SPOILER - In some way `` How to Alienate Friends ... . '' is the `` loser learns to adjust , becomes successful and finds out that something else matter more '' type of story , situated in the celebrity business . - END OF SPOILER I do n't know the original book but this comedy delivers several good moments . Though I do think the ending is flawed . It felt too fast and too abrupt , as if something was missing . Besides I 'd say the movie is n't able to keep a high level . Apart from this you 'll find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting qualities . Until now I 've never seen Pegg any different . Still he is a very unique type though on the screen he sometimes might seem a little more tedious than necessary . Fox proved she is capable to play a hot starlet with her head in the clouds . Do n't know whether it was a hard thing to do , but her performance was hot and way better than during `` Transformers '' ( okay ... probably that 's no tough match ) . Kirsten Dunst is very much Kirsten Dunst ( again ) and you may like it ( as I do ) or find it annoying . On the other hand you 'll see Anderson who proved her acting skills and Jeff Bridges ( who is fine but perhaps he could have acted a little more powerful ) . They all fit their character well enough . Conclusion : I think it 's a nice celeb comedy with some more and some less funny passages , a sweet cast but an all too sudden ending ."

Rhoda struggles with a photography career . And Meredith ... what exactly does she do again ? These three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way . When the two long time friends reunite , it only makes the film better . I was surprised about how good the writing was . The little jokes thrown in by Mary and Rhoda were funny . The script itself was very well put together . I had seen Moore and Harper in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good . But I had no idea that they worked this well as a team . While both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie , they never seem to let me down . ( During the run of this movie . ) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles okay but nothing great . The rest of the cast like Jonah , Cecile and ... .everybody else also works well together . Being that this is a reunion , you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this . From a non-fan I still enjoyed this little get-together . Good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good . ( The newer version of the MTM theme song does n't hurt either . )"

George C. Scott is absolutely amazing and totally believable as Scrooge . The supporting cast is equally spectacular . This is , to my mind , a flawless production . Little details add much to the enjoyment . The game `` similes '' Scrooge 's nephew and wife play with their party guests is a neat item .

18,1,train,"Passport to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema . Not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy , but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age , with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in British life . Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton , who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb , discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th Century Duke of Burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last 600 years . Accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by King Edward IV of England ( which has never been officially rescinded ) to state that that particular London street had been declared Burgandian soil , which means that in the eyes of international law , Pemberton and the other local residents are no longer British subjects but natives of Burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it 's own right and a law unto itself . This sets the war-battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of English law and jurisdiction , so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books , destroy and ignore their clothing coupons , flagrantly disregard British licencing laws etc , declaring themselves fully independent from Britain . However , what then happens is ever spiv , black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the 'border ' into Burgundy as a refuge from the law and post-war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods , and half of London 's consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration , making their quiet happy little haven , a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that . Appealing to Whitehall for assistance , they are told that due to developments this is `` now a matter of foreign policy , which His Majesty 's Government is reluctant to become involved '' which leaves the residents high and dry . They do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road , mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of Pimlico . Eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege , with the Bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food , but never the less fighting on in true British style . As one Bugundian resident quotes , `` we 're English and we always were English , and it 's just because we are English , we are fighting so hard to be Bugundians '' A sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of London learn of the poor Bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them , by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades . Will Whitehall , who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it 's knees by this new batch of foreigners , especially as these ones are English ! ! ! ! Great tale , and great fun throughout . Not to be missed ."

I got to appreciate Charlton Heston 's acting after seeing him in Orson Welles ' Touch of Evil . He was ( maybe is ) capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi-heroic people . Here , he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt ( taking rare food treats from the rich ) , and being totally corrupt ( actively condoning evil ) . The movie all seems to take place at night , and sweat is dripping off everyone , except in one of the rare air-conditioned apartments . Even though I had n't seen it before , I knew the famous ending ( which will not here be revealed ) , but the ending is certainly foreshadowed . Great scenes with Edward G.

Together , they decide to protect Celebi from the villain of the story , the Team Rocket agent aptly named Vicious , who is hell-bent on capturing Celebi for his own ends . Will Ash and Sam be able to protect Celebi from Vicious ' Dark Balls ? Where does Suicune fit into the picture ? Will Jessie , James , and Meowth have bigger parts in this movie than before ? And just who is Sam , really ? Like with the first 3 movies , if you go into the movie deciding that you 're automatically going to hate it no matter what simply because it 's Pokemon ( or just because your child/niece/nephew/younger sibling/et cetera `` dragged '' you into it ) , then you 're going to hate it because you 've decided that you want to hate it . That may be , but to blindly trash `` Pokemon The 4th Movie '' simply because it is a Pokemon movie , and especially without having seen it , is just plain stupid . Even non-fans can enjoy this movie without having to know every last detail of the world of Pokemon . I 'm not saying that you WILL become a Pokemon fan because of this movie , but you CAN indeed enjoy it , if you 'll let yourself . Unlike the first 3 Pokemon movies , `` Pokemon the 4th Movie '' is being distributed by Miramax , who I 've heard is also working on securing the rights to the 5th Pokemon movie , which was released this past summer in Japan . Miramax claims to have some boffo-aggressive marketing strategy for `` Pokemon The 4th Movie , '' but all I 've seen so far is a feeble limited release , which does n't include the usual Pikachu short in the beginning , which I was really looking forward to this time . I hope that Miramax will see fit to put the Pikachu short , called `` Pikachu 's Exciting Hide-and-Seek , '' onto at least the DVD/VHS release , if not with a future wider release of `` Pokemon The 4th Movie . '' I hope that the current release is just the tip of the iceberg for this very entertaining film ."

Not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of Yankovic 's more memorable videos ( `` Like A Surgeon '' and `` I Love Rocky Road '' among them ) , but they are inter-spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist 's rise to fame . Yankovic is not for all tastes , but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will at least be lightly amused . Die-hard fans will love it not only for its content , but also for its relatively early look into Yankovic 's now nearly three decade career . Suitable for all ages , kiddies will no doubt love the funny visuals ."
25,1,train,"I first saw the film when it landed on US cable a year after it came out . It blew my little head away , I was only 16 and it was the first new wave music I 'd heard , having been a strictly folky , classical kid growing up . The music mesmerized me , as did Hazel O'Connor 's amazing look and charismatic vocal performances , and Phil Daniels ' tough but soft Cockney manager just stole my heart . But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce 's drugged out sax player . He was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic , he just begged for sympathy . Favorite scenes , the performance when the lights went out , and the love scene on the train . Okay , so the movie is n't the Rose ! But it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the Britain of the early 80 's , exploding with rebellious youth , looking for a way out of the dole queue . I went to Britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was there . If you get a chance to , see it . It is a great movie , with some wonderful performances , and the music will blow you away ."

27,1,train,"Dolph Lundgren is back ! Detention marks Dolphs first film in nearly 2 years , and that is following the delayed Hidden Agenda . This film still marks an improvement for Dolph over his cheapie trilogy of Jill Rips , Agent Red and Stormcatcher . However this film is well below the standard of Hidden Agenda , which was better in almost every respect . What this film does have in it 's favour from Dolph 's previous outing , is a sense of cheesy fun . The film also has a rejuvenated Dolph back in a high action role , and it 's good to see Dolph doing his own stunts again . The films story is ludicrous and prime B-movie material . An ex-military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching , whilst taking a Detention class , he runs into some Slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal . The film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches . If you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy . Thankfully the filmmakers do n't take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability , this film has a so bad it 's enjoyable kind of vibe . Where the film is let down is miss-using a fairly decent budget . The budget of around 10 million has not been well spent . It 's all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination . The opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse . There are some good moments . You have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning , with plenty of destruction . The rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen . As for the cast . Hidden Agenda boasted the best cast Dolph has worked with in ages . There was a good standard of actors for a DTV film . This however has problems . The actors are on the most part bad . The bad guys are terrible , but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because Alex Karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness . The teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters . They all hate authority , each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons , but generally they are decent and Chris Collins in particular has a likeability . This movie is all about Dolph though . While this film is nowhere near his best , it is nowhere near his worst . It also marks a turning point in his career . He is now back in good shape , and will be in even better shape in his next film Direct Action . Dolph looks enthusiastic here , he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man ( running from explosions in slow-mo , one liners , and handling large weapons ) again in a movie like his older ones , albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like Army Of One . It is good to see Dolph looking energised . His films of the last 8 or so years have seen Dolph looking a little more weary , and using doubles a lot ( he still does all the fights himself though ) but the new streamlined Dolph seems up for it . Overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and Dolph in prime action man mode . There 's not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm . **"
28,1,train,"The absolute summum of the oeuvre of that crafty Dane Douglas Sirk ( born Detlef Sierck ) , Written on the Wind compels our prurient attention in every gaudy frame . From its justly famous opening sequence , with the leaves blowing into the baronial foyer of a Texas mansion and the wind riffling the pages of the calendar into a flashback , the movie compresses into its 99 minutes all the familial intrigue that was to fuel such later , little-screen knockoffs as Dallas , Dynasty and Falcon Crest over their years-long runs . The combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme Americans , in our dollar-based society , find irresistible . Brother and sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the spoiled , troubled heirs to the Hadly oil fortune ; boyhood chum Rock Hudson and new bride Lauren Bacall are the sane outsiders who try to keep the lid on the roiling cauldron . ( It 's been rumored that the story was based on Libby Holmann 's marriage into Reynolds tobacco money . ) As always , the misfits get all the scenery to chew -- and the best lines to spit out ( Malone , in her Oscar-nabbing performance as the boozing nymphomaniac with a jones for Hudson , gets to detonate a whole fireworks display of them ) . Hudson , while good , ca n't compete with all this over-the-top emoting ; Bacall starts out strong but grows recessive , a mere plot convenience . No matter ; with a succession of set-pieces shot in extravagant hues , Sirk gives an object lesson in how to turn out overwrought melodrama set in the lush consumer paradise of late-50s America . Nobody ever did it better ."
29,1,train,"If you 're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as 'Book of the Dead ' , 'Book of Eibon ' or 'Necronomicon ' , then you should feel right at home with Malefique , a film which also features an occult tome , one with the power to change the destinies of all involved . Discovered by four French prisoners sharing a cell , the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by Danvers , a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s ; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished . Finders of the book are Carrère ( Gérald Laroche ) a company embezzler shopped by his wife , Lassalle ( Philippe Laudenbach ) who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan , the halfwit Pâquerette ( Dimitri Rataud ) who once ate his baby sister , and the 'librarian ' Marcus ( Clovis Cornillac ) , supposedly driven mad by reading , who murdered his wife . Reminding the viewer of Meat Loaf 's equally bizarre , bosomy male in Fight Club ( 1999 ) , Lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet , one who is especially protective of the infantile Pâquerette . With the coming of the book however , and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents , Marcus assumes greater and greater significance . At first assured of an early bail , meanwhile Carrère takes little more than academic interest in events . Suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and , as the prisoners experiment , Danvers ' book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers ... Staged for the most part within a prison cell , and between four or five characters , Malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter ( as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers ) . Only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell , a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed , closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere . More than anything , this is a film about being trapped , either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding . `` I 'm going to escape , '' says Carrère at the start of the film , wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son . Whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price , and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an 'escape ' may not be one a man might imagine . With all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director Eric Vallette 's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does . As critics have noticed , it is a film with strong Freudian overtones - Lassalle 's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance ; the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye ; the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus ; Danvers ' original placenta fetish ; the dark cell as a primitive womb from which 'delivery ' is awaited , etc . With so many interesting aspects to the script Vallette hardly puts a foot wrong , and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what , when one comes down to it , is just a matter of four guys , four bunks , one folding table and a book . There 's a genuine , growing , Lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages , while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina , or what ultimately happens to Pâquerette - are unsettlingly memorable . The pacing of many of the dark events in Malefique is deliberate , rejecting the rapid cutting of many Hollywood productions : a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore . Perhaps this is a particularly European manner , as one recalls a similar , measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as Verhoeven 's The Fourth Man ( 1983 ) - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye . Lensed well in 1.85:1 , Malefique benefits from excellent performances and , if for this viewer at least , the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been , the journey to the final shot was worth taking . Coming so soon after the release of the similarly well-received Haute Tension ( aka : Switchblade Romance , 2003 ) , this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the French industry , this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from Asia"
30,1,val,"Time and time again , it seems that the comedic actors of Hollywood are surprising me with their talents as dramatic performers : first it was Robin Williams { 'One Hour Photo ( 2002 ) ' } , then it was Jim Carrey { 'Eternal Sunshine ( 2004 ) ' being one example } , then Will Ferrell { 'Stranger than Fiction ( 2006 ) ' } and now Adam Sandler . Yes , that 's absolutely right : the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless , goofball comedies { I 'm not complaining ; I 've always been a fan } has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud . Of course , some readers may be wondering whatever happened to 'Punch-Drunk Love ( 2002 ) , ' but I can only assure you that it 's a film I 'm currently taking measures to see as soon as possible , since I 've heard it 's terrific . My first film from director Mike Binder , 'Reign Over Me , ' is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship . Though it does occasionally stray into all-too-familiar territory , the somewhat predictable storyline proves surprisingly deep and moving , with both Sandler and Don Cheadle giving memorable performances . Alan Johnson ( Cheadle ) is a successful dentist with a good family , though he finds himself unable to communicate adequately with his wife ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) and so his marriage is a little shaky . Charlie Fineman ( Adam Sandler ) is Alan 's ex-college roommate , a man who lost his entire family in the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and who is still confronting his overwhelming feelings of grief . A disheveled figure with messy hair and downcast eyes { often likened in appearance to Bob Dylan } , Charlie has abandoned his career in dentistry , and spends his time in solitude : listening to music with headphones that cut out all sound from the outside world , driving around Manhattan in his motorised scooter , immersing himself in fantastical video games and repeatedly redecorating his apartment kitchen in accordance with his deceased wife 's final wishes . When Alan and Charlie meet for the first time in years , the latter does n't even recognise an old friend , having completely abandoned any memories prior to his life-crippling experience . Indeed , at first he does n't even acknowledge the existence of his family , and abruptly loses his temper whenever anybody suggests that he seek counselling . Initially , it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the September 11 attacks as a storytelling device . Afterall , would n't it be just as devastating if Charlie 's family had died in an ordinary , everyday car accident ? However , if you consider that the director 's intention was to demonstrate the enormous pain caused to ordinary citizens by the tragedy , then 'Reign Over Me ' does a very good job . It 's easy to get so caught up in meaningless statistics that you neglect the emotional costs of the terrorist attacks ; this is the first 9/11-orientated film I 've seen that truly dealt with the suffering of those who were n't even involved , whose only anguish was caused through losing those whom they loved . Adam Sandler shows surprising range in a difficult role , one which would have crumbled to pieces had he not been up to the task . Snapping instantly between cheerfulness , anger and depression , Charlie Fineman is a man with whom we can deeply sympathise , a hollow soul who , thanks to the companionship of an old friend , can finally glimpse light at the end of a dark , bleak tunnel ."

I enjoy watching it again and again . The only minus , and why I did n't give it a 10 , is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up .

33,1,train,"Pufnstuf is what it is . I saw this in the cinema at age 4 and I have very fond , and vivid , memories of it . Seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience - like the bit where Jimmy 's grey witch wig is ripped off and Witch Hazel ( Cass ) sneers `` I KNEW she had brown roots ! '' . It is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time , and in some ways quite progressive . The track Different , for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself , not running with the pack , and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different . This could be an anthem to the gay community , it should be , great track . Martha Raye , Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all great as witches , and the Living Island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits ( includes Billy Barty , Felix Silla and other famous names ) . There is a LOT of over acting in this film - there 's really nothing subtle , and when little Jack Wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of Living Island it 's really little more than yelling . This is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel . While I think of it - I never could stand the flute though . I love the soundtrack , especially the above mentioned Different but also Zap The World , Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild 's touching If I Could .

Very good for my ( at the time school- ) English , as Dutch TV provides subtitles for other languages , except for kiddies shows nowadays . So you would hear the original voices and language . - The best series were the first three ones and then after the third series , the great character , Nazi Von Gelb , who was such a formidable enemy , disappeared from the series ( I do n't think they ever really caught him , he always escaped , leaving room to have him appear again in a next story ) because evidently the series also was distributed to Germany , and a Nazi enemy would n't go over very well ! Too bad , because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent Nazi aristocrat , who had this ongoing obsession to take revenge on England . It was a true delight to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series , but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal . They were very believable to me at the time and as a kid I could just imagine to be part of these youngsters , who at the time were about four years older than me . It was a very exciting series to me , standing out in my memory of those times as a special show with `` the Prisoner '' as well . I hope they will publish a good quality DVD of the series , that would be wonderful . Even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch . The later series were not as good , watered down and just not as much fun as the first three . Hopefully they also find the other series with Von Gelb to be put on DVD . Greetings from Canada ."

The stakes are , of course , high -- will the police and Widmark , the public health doctor , apprehend the criminals who do n't know that they are carrying plague before a full-scale epidemic breaks out ? But smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene -- between Widmark and the police captain , between the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel , between Palance and a dying plague-stricken man whom Palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity , between Widmark and his wife , and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full-scale panic . The movie is beautifully shot by Kazan , in extraordinarily well-choreographed long takes shot on location in New Orleans , and ends in a stunning climax , where Palance flees like a rat from his pursuers , through the docks and warehouses of the city . The commentary is superb , probably the best that I 've heard , covering the cinematography , the framing and lighting of shots , the production design , the casting of non-professional actors in small roles , and the ironies and parallelisms in the plot , like an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally .

A lot of films we watched when we were younger do n't seem to hold up when we watch them later in life . The film is actually a great 80 's example of the type of films made then . Keaton is at his best , all the actors actually did a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it . The pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80 's is too funny . Being from the 80 's I loved seeing the ugly pacer again .

Most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude . In conclusion , I hope viewers learn something from it , in addition seeing it for entertainment .

42,1,train,"This film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind . First , the central father-son relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his Wong Fei Hung film `` Drunken Master '' ( ideas from this film recur in `` Drunken Master II ) , and not `` Young Master '' ; that Chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly ; and , indeed , the film conveys a sense of being incomplete ; for instance , the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film . `` Young Master '' , from the same period , also feels underdone , but at least all its central threads are tied together at the end . This film feels as though Chan wrestled with the plot and characters trying to find his central theme , only to abandon the effort , possibly due to time and budget . Or perhaps the film is simply over-ambitious . This is an important turning point film in Chan 's career , because he commits himself to development of the central character above all other concerns - which is why there 's such a lack of kung fu throughout the film . Chan wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it . But both the historical element and the romantic element come across as little more than plot-twists . That leaves us with the comedy . Since Chan 's concern is character-development , the comedy is largely character driven - as in the conflict between Chan 's character and his best friend , an argument over a girl . But there 's plenty of slapstick as well . Frankly , I find the comedy amusing enough to forgive the incompleteness of the plot . This film represents an effort on Chan 's part to find a viable formula that he can use and develop over time . It does n't quite work , and Chan would only find that formula after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films , with the making of the contemporary action comedy `` Police Story '' . But going back to view this film is still very informative as to how Chan worked his way through the historical genre , and perhaps why he abandoned it ."
43,1,train,"THE MAN IN THE MOON is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950 's .

The 1950 's are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately . Witherspoon already begins to show the Oscar-winning talent she would develop in this early role and London makes a charming leading man . Warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well . Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the girls ' parents and Gail Strickland , who plays London 's mom .

45,1,train,"This early film has its flaws -- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance -- but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock 's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images . It 's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically ; note , for examples , the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery . Its core , though , remains the final match , which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing . Even though you know that the hero has to win , it becomes quite believable that he will lose , and the movement of his wife from the champion 's corner to his , motivating the final plot pay-off , is very well entwined with the progress of the match . The inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should ; you can almost hear the ticking ( even though this is a silent film , the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them ) . The pacing becomes astonishingly rapid , and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it . The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight , a public domain company . As with each Hitchcock silent they 've released , they 've attached various musical selections , mostly orchestral , to the action . The sound editing is frequently sloppy , and the sound quality varies widely , but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices , and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well ; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here . This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest . It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films ."

It sparked my interest , but I never expected it to be this great . Before Sunrise is a masterpiece , and it 's also one of the most romantic films on record . To my surprise , it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s . It 's impossible to really talk too much about it , since there is no real plot , so to speak ( although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about ; it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre , where there is a conversation , but it 's not JUST the conversation that matters ) , but let me just say , see it . SEE IT !"

According To Slavoj Zizek , the host and analyst of this intellectually tickling tour de force , Groucho is the superego , Chico the ego , and Harpo the id . Scenes from the above listed films are used to illustrate concepts : the role of fantasy in shaping reality and vice-versa , the father figure , male and female libido , death drive , etc . Here are some of Slavoj utterances ( most as paraphrases ) : `` desire is a wound on reality '' , `` fantasy realized is a nightmare '' , `` music is the opium of the people '' ( borrowing from K.

The whole is bracketed by an intro that declares `` you do n't look for your desires in movies , instead cinema tells you what you should desire '' and concludes with the cineaste view that `` cinema is needed today so that we can understand our current reality '' -- I say , as long as censorship does n't derail it .

52,1,train,"The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious . It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics , from especially Stan Laurel of course as usual . The movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula . It does n't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending . It 's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless , so it works for the movie . The supporting cast of the movie is surprising good . Sam Adams is great as the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top as the nutty professor .

53,1,train,"Like `` My Sassy Girl '' , this movie is based on a true story posted from the internet , but that 's where the similarities end . The story is generally about this rebellious guy named Ji-Hoon ( Kwon Sang Woo ) who is still trying to finish high school , whose parents hire a tutor named Su-Wan ( Kim Ha Neul ) , a woman who comes from a poor background , but happens to be the same age as him . Add to that some obstacles , martial arts ( thugs are always after Ji-Hoon for revenge ) , a scorned , thuggish love-sick girl who is after him , his proclivity for ditching the lessons , and you generally can guess the whole story . Did I mention it 's a romantic comedy ? This movie has some good fight scenes , great visual humor and a lot of spunk , thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo , that bring a lot of energy to the story . The romantic elements also work because of that reason . And , I must say , I 'd want a girlfriend more like Kim Ha Nuel than that girl from `` My Sassy Girl '' ( personality-wise , at least ) . She has some spunk , but it 's more on the cute , sweet , good-hearted way . Characters are already mostly likable ( so one might say it had less of a hill to climb than `` My Sassy Girl '' -- an obstacle that worked for that movie to its credit ) , and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the way . The story kind of sags , though , about 2/3 of the way ( where it sort of treads on familiar , standard fare , where nothing really interesting happens ) , but near the end , it picks up a bit again .

( main exception would be Hilary Duff that plays the well known materialistic pop star , need i say name ( S ) ? ) . at its CORE the feature is an anti-globalization gig , period . the message is unmistakeably delivered with comic vengeance .

The raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed , so true . The final sequence is almost unbearably poignant : when Clark Gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son , lifts him up and proudly says , `` My kid ! `` , I could n't help remember that Mr. Gable 's own son was born to him posthumously .

In any case the affects are secondary . I wo n't give anything away about the plot . The plot structure has a Russian Doll aspect a little reminiscent of Basic Instinct ( though with very different content ) .

Evidently , it was also `` too cryptic '' according to some critics after the fact . * - It apparently did SO badly that Disney said , `` Screw it , let 's re-release 'Spy Kids ' '' .

61,1,train,"This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one man industry . This movie will also tell you why Indian movie-goers are astute buyers . Amitabh was at the peak of his domination of Bollywood when his one-time godfather Prakash Mehra decided to use his image yet again . Prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it , adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and clichés to it . Zanzeer saw the making of Angry Young Man . Lawaris was about being a bastard and Namak Halal was about the master-servant loyalties . But then , the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song , dance and drama . What comprised of the movie is a caricature of a Haryanavi who goes to Mumbai and turns into a regulation hero . Amitabh 's vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks , thanks to his flawless stock Haryanvi accent . To me , this alone is the biggest pull in the movie . The rest all is typical Bollywood screen writing . Amitabh , by now , had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies . Thanks to Manmohan Desai . This movie had a good dose of them . The shoe caper in the party , the monologue over Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare 's considerations , The mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard Amitabh fare . Shashi Kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody , finicky character ( Remember him asking Ranjeet to `` Shaaadaaaap '' after the poisoned cake incident '' ) . His was the all important role of the master while Amitabh was his loyal servant . But Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind ... and so Shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie . It was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie . But this is a caper , remember ? And as long as it stayed that way , the people came and saw Amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy . The end is always predictable , and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol , the age-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well . So what is it that makes this movie a near classic ? Amitabh Bacchan as the Haryanvi . Prakash Mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story . Chuck the story , the characters and the plot . My marks are for Amitabh alone ."
62,1,train,"Obsession comes in many flavors , and exists for a variety of reasons ; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder , but for others it may be an avenue of survival . Lack of nurturing , combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements , may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone . And in extreme cases , the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession , driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing , and as we discover in ` The Luzhin Defence , ' directed by Marleen Gorris , a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem , and in fact , may actually exacerbate the situation . Obsession , it seems , has no prejudice or preference ; moreover , it gives no quarter . At an Italian resort in the 1920 's , Alexander Luzhin ( John Turturro ) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament , the winner of which will be the World Champion . Luzhin is a Master of the game , but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him ; rather , it is his obsession , that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life , and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family . So Luzhin is a genius with an Achilles heel , a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands , and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament . That man is Valentinov ( Stuart Wilson ) , Luzhin 's former mentor , who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to Luzhin . Valentinov is an unwelcomed , disconcerting presence to Luzhin , and once again life threatens to overwhelm him . Not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament , Turati ( Fabio Sartor ) , against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours , but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life -- his feelings for a young woman he 's just met at the resort , Natalia ( Emily Watson ) . And , genius though he may be , dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push Luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace , as well the curse , of his entire life . To tell Luzhin 's story , Gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess . And as his background is established , it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who Luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life . For the scenes of his childhood , Gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into , and underlies , the present , more pastoral setting of the resort . The transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled , and with the pace Gorris sets it makes for a riveting , yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well . She also underplays the menace produced by the presence of Valentinov , concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense , which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film , making Luzhin 's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling . The single element that makes this film so memorable , however , is the affecting performance of John Turturro . For this film to work , Luzhin must be absolutely believable ; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous , as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately . It does n't happen , however , and the film does work , because the Luzhin Turturro creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life . He captures Luzhin 's genius , as well as his inadequacies , and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real . It 's a performance equal to , if not surpassing , Geoffrey Rush 's portrayal of David Helfgott in ` Shine . ' And when you compare his work here with other characters he 's created , from Sid Lidz in ` Unstrung Heroes ' to Pete in ` O Brother Where Art Thou ? ' to Al Fountain in ` Box of Moonlight , ' you realize what an incredible range Turturro has as an actor , and what a remarkable artist he truly is . As Natalia , Emily Watson is excellent , as well , turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely . Though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to Luzhin , Watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective . Most importantly , because of the detail she brings to her performance , it makes her accelerated relationship with Luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story . You have but to look into Watson 's eyes to know that the feelings she 's conveying are real . It 's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor . The supporting cast includes Geraldine James ( Vera ) , Christopher Thompson ( Stassard ) , Peter Blythe ( Ilya ) , Orla Brady ( Anna ) , Mark Tandy ( Luzhin 's Father ) , Kelly Hunter ( Luzhin 's Mother ) , Alexander Hunting ( Young Luzhin ) and Luigi Petrucci ( Santucci ) . Well crafted and delivered , ` The Luzhin Defence ' is an emotionally involving film , presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man 's inhumanity to man . We do n't need a movie , of course , to tell us that there is cruelty in the world ; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget , inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change , and to make a difference in the lives of those around us . I rate this one 9/10 ."

65,1,train,"In Canadian director Kari Skogland 's film adaptation of the Margaret Laurence novel The Stone Angel Ellen Burstyn is Hagar Shipley , a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end , stubbornly refusing to be placed in a nursing home by her well-meaning son Marvin . Filmed in Manitoba , Canada and set in the fictional town of Manawaka , The Stone Angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in Canadian high school English classes for almost half a century . The title of the film comes from the stone statue erected on Hagar 's mother 's grave which serves as a metaphor for Hagar 's inability to express emotion during her tumultuous lifetime . Burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego-driven , self-defeating character who managed to alienate her wealthy father , her well-meaning but alcoholic husband , and both of her sons . As she nears the end of her days , she reflects that `` pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear . I was alone , never anything else , and never free , for I carried my chains within me , and they spread out from me and shackled all I touched '' . Confronting having to spend her last days in a nursing home , Hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships , her recollections shown in flashbacks without voice-over narration . The story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl . Chaperoned by her Aunt Dolly , she meets her future husband , the previously married Bram Shipley ( Cole/Wings Hauser ) , a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is sullied because of his association with the Native American population . The young Hagar is played by Christine Horne who is exceptional in her first feature role . Despite Hagar 's pleading , her relationship with Bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot . This is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of Manawaka , condemning the young couple to a life of poverty . Going through the motions of her marriage to Bram , Hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town 's upper classes . When she produces two sons , Marvin ( Dylan Baker ) and John ( Kevin Zegers ) , she is unable to give them the love that they need . `` Every joy I might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning '' , she reflects , `` all were forced to a standstill by some break of proper appearances When did I ever speak the heart 's truth ? '' Like the biblical Hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride , Hagar leaves Manawaka to live in Ontario but eventually returns to the Shipley farm . As the scene shifts back to the present , Hagar runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a nursing home by Marvin and his wife Doris ( Sheila McCarthy ) , Here she meets a young man named Leo ( Luke Kirby ) who takes an interest in her and compels her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life . The Stone Angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where I felt any stake in the story 's outcome , although the spirited performance by Ellen Page as John 's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film 's second half ."

I kept expecting it to fall apart , but it never really did . Sure , it does n't make as much of its awesome premise as it could , and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the film 's universe . But I ca n't blame it for that .

He 's given two of the best comic performances of 2006 ( the other in the pretty much unreleased Idiocracy ) . I absolutely cracked up at the expressions on his face when he and Thurman first have sex . It 's one of the funniest sex scenes ever . My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl a bit too much of a psycho , like almost unbelievably so . Maybe with some background I could have accepted it better . I can forgive its flaws , though , because I had a really good time watching it . Underrated , for sure ."

The budget is painfully low . No special effects whatsoever , and they seemingly used ambient lighting ( shot in digital video . ) -And yet this movie grabs hold of you and never lets go . The screenplay is somewhat bizarre , yet the actors and director pull it off with complete realism . It has humor , it has intrigue , and it has pathos , and it all works together . No point in describing the details . If you want to see an independant masterpiece , a virtual lesson in how to make a low budget flick that really works , see this one . -Oh yeah , it 's also REALLY entertaining ."
69,1,train,"This documentary was very thorough and exposing , and at the same time entertaining , which I thought was rather impressive . I felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its ' origin until present day , but nonetheless , there is a reason why I do not give such a high score to this film ... I felt as if at times the story focused too much on the 'proper nouns ' of the sport , so to speak : too much on individual locations at which to surf , and especially too much on individual surfers . I felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport , the ideology of the sport , etc . it would have been better ( although this of course was covered , I do not think it got as much time as it warranted ) . And for many people who are not absolutely nuts about surfing , at times hearing them go on and on about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring . Although the video clips and the in-depth research is well-respected , it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers . Furthermore , my biggest disappointment was at times they spoke of how utterly amazing and miraculous certain events in surfing history were yet they did not have the actual footage of these events unfolding , and the whole time you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing , breath-taking event that these men are talking about as life-changing moments , and in the end all you get is a lot of men talking about it , and not the actual footage . It was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories , and then be unable to see them . I understand the difficulty of obtaining footage of everything , but please : do not brag an event up so much , and then not show it . Overall , a very fresh documentary that I enjoyed watching ; not the best documentary due to the above reasons , but being very fresh and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack , it is a documentary that I would advise everybody to check out ."
70,1,train,"The idea of making a film about the Beatles sounds doomed idea , as no production can catch the idea of the actual historic Beatles . Then it is perhaps best not to try to recreate the past , but to produce an illustration that works best with the other available Beatles material . This is exactly what 'Birth of the Beatles ' offers to us , the simple story known to us without any extravaganza . *** SPOILERS here on *** Be warned that not everything is that accurate as some Beatles-graduates might expect . The Beatles are seen performing songs that hardly were even composed by that time . The Beatles perform `` Ask Me Why '' , `` P.S . I Love You '' and even `` Do n't Bother Me '' . The Beatles-graduates should see that if the Beatles on the film only performed songs that they actually did at Hamburg , the younger viewers might not anymore recognize the Beatles they have learned to know them . Of that original Hamburg repertoire only `` Johnny B. Goode '' and Stu Sutcliffe 's `` Love Me Tender '' are retained . The guys who play the Beatles in this production scarcely look like the originals , but the rest of the film still make good viewing as the film is for the rest fairly accurate . The guy who plays Lennon does it good and the rest of the band are not bad either . Brian Epstein is great and the moment when he sacks Pete Best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole film . Also as a bonus you get to see the original Cavern club in the film ."

I was very impressed by the original John Carpenter 's Vampires and when I descovered there was a sequel I went straight out and bought it . This movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first , and it is not quite so dark , but it is close enough and I felt that it built nicely on the original . Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss : his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives . One of my favourite parts was just after he meets Zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems . His comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds . The other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film . It is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way Fright Night II grew out of Fright Night . There are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme . If you like vampire movies I would recommend this one . If you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else ."
72,1,train,"Set in World Depression Era Prague , this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters , only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop , who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague . Add a little twist ( the owner is convinced that his favorite employee -Stewart- is having an affair with the owner 's wife ) , leaving Stewart briefly 'fired ' , along with an admission that the sales girl 'liked ' Stewart all along , the happy ending is inevitable . Although VERY dated ( references to poverty and -I have a wife and two kids to consider- are over-used , along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure , like a musical cigar box , are out-of-reach for common people 's enjoyment ) , this film is much more effective ( and more credible ) than the 1990s re-make `` You 've Got Mail '' . In the re-make starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan , the actual odds of the chain-of-events are so unbelievable that the viewer 's intelligence is grossly offended . `` Shop Around The Corner '' is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated , less hectic , and more romantic time and place known as a novelist 's Utopia . Lovers of Classic Romantic Comedies will enjoy this picture !"
73,1,train,"Having read the reviews for this film , I understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good . However , this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time . The majority of reviews that i had read , said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow . And whilst some parts do leave you confused , the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you 've missed so much . It 's not like `` Lock , Stock ... '' or `` Snatch '' , in the sense that it is n't that funny ( in fact , it 's pretty dark ) , and it is a lot more intelligent , in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints ( and , in one of the best scenes of the film , Jason Statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself ) . The way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned , is that it is full of memorable characters , specifically Statham , who gives a fantastic performance as the lead , and Ray Liotta , who spends most of the film in Speedos , but gives a great performance none the less . If you 've got time , and have time afterwards to think about the film , and even watch it again , you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film . I think it 's fantastic , and that Guy Ritchie is a director on top of his game ."
74,1,train,"THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE Written by Mary Harron & Guinevere Turner Directed by Mary Harron How do you define a person who has always been between two worlds , one of presumed sin and one of supposed redemption ? Especially when that person eventually succumbed to a split personality disorder in her latter years as if to demonstrate her own point . If you 're director Mary Harron , you do n't shy away from showing the push/pull nature of THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE . You allow the character to drift back and forth between the healing forgiveness of the power of God and the church and the seductive illusion of control and dominance afforded to Page during her years as a pinup model . By doing so , audiences are offered a complex character that is propelled forward by a desire to leave her difficult past with a naive enjoyment in others ' lust for her and a struggle to reconcile her image in the eyes of God . Come the right time , it will no longer matter how many eyes are on her because there is only one pair that counts . Shot mostly in black and white ( with some unnecessary bursts of color ) , THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE is at times a light , humorous comedy , making the film an enjoyable experience and also one that pokes fun at how seriously people believe in the corruption of pornography . But the delicate hand of the director is more palpably felt during Page 's times of despair . Harron is a sensitive , considerate director who does not throw Page 's numerous and devastating blows of abuse in the face of her viewer . Instead , she allows the surprisingly effective Gretchen Moll , who plays the title role , the chance to hammer the pain of her character into the viewer with fear in her eyes , exhaustion is her cries and shame on her skin . Whereas most directors , perhaps most male directors , would find it essential to show the heroine in painful positions in order to draw a link between the kinds of atrocities that were put upon her and where her life took her , Harron has too much compassion for her character , her actress and her audience . From fragility , Page learns to trust people again and as more and more photographers fall in love with her image , the more she falls in love with their admiration and the control she has over the gaze . By the time her poses cross over into the realm of soft-core S & M , she has found a way to combine her need to be respected with the objectification she has been accustomed to her whole life . Mary Harron 's Bettie Page is a woman who yearns for control over her life and destiny , yet ultimately is always being told where to stand , how to smile and what to wear . When she finally realizes that none of her choices have been her own , she chooses to embrace God and preach his word to those who will listen . The true sadness behind this most important decision is that she is still letting someone else guide her blindly ; she just has more faith that this direction will be better for her soul ."

76,1,val,"OK ... this movie so far has been slated by critics and board-posters alike ( although playing devil 's advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who did n't make it for themselves as film-makers , and board posters are often people who did n't make it for themselves as critics ) so I wanted to sit in Guy 's corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who 've decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it . The film 's biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is . This has been described many times as as making the film `` inaccessible '' to the viewer . The film 's chronology is relatively non-linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle ( or not so subtle ) hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory , IE . Ray Liotta 's character brandishing a gun saying the words `` fear me '' is portrayed as both tragically pathetic ( from Statham 's POV ) or interrogating and bold ( from Liotta 's POV ) . This is but one example of Ritchie 's far more mature approach he has taken to film-making with Revolver , we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal ( the strong but silent gritty anti-hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption ... I mean it 's paint by numbers film noir here guys , all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice-overs ) but then Guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points . Take the scene where Jason Statham 's character runs afoul of a car . This throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever ... but Ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death . So the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling , I 'd be taking the p*ss if I said I did n't spend the last 20 minutes or so of the film turning to my date going `` uh ... wtf ? '' ... but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art . It is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand . And even easier to say `` well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film ! '' . In my humble opinion , Revolver is a stylish , complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the Saatchi Brothers . If we choose this opportunity to collectively say `` Ah sh*t , I wanted a film about a load of bleeding ' cockney gangsters in-nit loll ... Guy Ritchie is a tit ! '' then the day will come when film-makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow , crappy people . Just because Guy made a name for himself with funny , cheeky cockney romps , does n't mean he ca n't be deep without being `` pretentious '' . Funny people can be thoughtful too ."

We watched this film in our sociology class in New Era University , and I did n't knew that It was a true story , I thought it was just created by an intellectual who want to bring a fresh air in the industry . It is very good . The part that shocked me was when Nadine abused Antwone ( who was just six ) sexually . If I were on his shoes , I could have jumped a ten-story high building . I salute him for he being so strong ! The scene that touched me here is when Antwone finally saw his mother Eva face to face .

The only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall , a doorway between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold . This film was just a joy to watch , it has something in it for everyone , all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny . If I had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be The Princess Bride , a classic . All the performances are outstanding , the beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in her portrayal of Yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as Larnia ... but the performance to talk about is Robert De Niro ... In every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show ... If you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film . Guys do n't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout .

I was prepared for disappointment . And when I realized it was shot entirely in black & white , I knew my erotic hopes were dashed . Boy , was I wrong ! Not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love , fear of the secret being found out , a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic . You will soon forget that it is shot in black & white . The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years . And the performances from the two stars ( Essy Persson and Anna Gael ) are intense and memorable . OK , so they 're both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls . It 's 1968 . Do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this ? Many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then . Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much . I think this movie was way ahead of its time . The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure ; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination , opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown . I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here . As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action : Although it wo n't be all you expect , I do n't think you 'll be too , too disappointed ."
80,1,train,"Out of the first five episodes of Hammer 's short-running `` Hammer House of Horror '' series , this fifth episode with the wonderful title `` The House that Bled to Death '' is arguably the creepiest one . As a great fan of the Hammer Studios ' Gothic Horror films for many years , I wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently . So far , I 've only seen the first five episodes , and I have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come , but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are , I will be satisfied . Whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor , this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine Horror . The episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations . Years later , William ( Nicholas Ball ) and Emma Peters ( Rachel Davies ) move in the house with their little daughter Sophie ( Emma Ridley ) . Soon after moving in , however , the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house , which is seemingly haunted ... The second episode directed by Francis Megahy is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry , `` Growing Pains '' ( Episode 4 ) , and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances . The film is also well-made in terms of effects , cinematography and score . `` The House that Bled to Death '' is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow Hammer-fans should like to see in a Short Horror tale . The film delivers a creepy atmosphere , genuine scare moments and intelligent twists , and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end . Overall , this is highly recommendable to Hammer fans ."

It 's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best , but I really disagree . Most people only know that movie because it one an Acedmy Award ; this is n't an exaggeration - I 've shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who 'd only ever seen Spirited Away , and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three . Personally , I 'd never thought that anything could compare to Princess Mononoke , until I finally saw Castle in the Sky . I still think that the prior is the better of the two , but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with it ; in many ways , Castle has major elements that Mononoke was missing .

However , the first half of the movie is all about Beery , his relationship with his service pals , and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother , and getting Drake 's leg fixed . Only then does the second film start . The second film is mostly LTAs in action , taking on a surfaced sub , guys get killed and much damage is caused . The look is fairly gritty and realistic , I imagine . Then we shift to Southeast Asia . Did the Navy have LTAs there ? Never mind , this part is really wild , with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle . And the Japs are shooting like mad .

90,1,val,"I must admit that this is the type of film that I would normally eschew , but I rented it basically because of the stars . I certainly was not sorry . In fact , as you see , I rated it five stars . This film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting . Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents ' jewelry store . The crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the Hanson family . Through a series of flashbacks , we get to know Charles Hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons . Younger brother , Hank is basically a screw-up . He has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind . Hank is insecure , cowardly , and very much under the influence of his big brother . Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank `` nailed to a T '' and gives what is probably his best performance thus far . He shows us a man who is basically good-hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task . Andy - on the surface - appears to be a successful businessman , but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit . It is Andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents ' store , and he gets weak-willed Hank to commit the act . Philip Seymour Hoffman - surely one of the finest actors of our time - plays Andy . Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who , on the surface , is a charming businessman liked by his acquaintances but a real slime ball underneath . He is absolutely perfect for the part of Andy or it might be said that he , through his superior acting skills , made Andy the perfect part . Albert Finney plays a father common to his generation . Charles Hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man , but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself . He has always been too quick to criticize and admonish . He always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional rift between himself and Andy . As we get to know Charles and Andy , the thought of Andy forming a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable . On a personal note , I can not believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of my own father , and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and myself . Perhaps this may be one of the reasons that I enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant , critical father , a more successful older brother , and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home . Fortunately , my brother and I never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents- guess we were made of sterner and more moral stuff . This complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director , Sidney Lumet . At eighty-three , he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge-of-seat action that hypnotizes . 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years prior to Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead , but he has n't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered . The events and characters in Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead are harsh and unattractive , and this is definitely not a feel-good movie . However , it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which I thoroughly recommend ."

And it 's gorgeous , compelling , exciting , and fun -- provided you do n't watch it around druggies who can not experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acid trip . Eventually the movie turns itself off , adding another compelling self-reflexive level to the proceedings . -- PolarisDiB"

95,1,train,"Thomas Ince always had a knack for bringing simple homespun stories to life with fullness and flair . `` The Italian '' is such a film . Solid acting , particularly by George Beban , father of silent child actor George Beban , Jr. , and wonderful sets convey a realistic feeling of early immigrant tenements in New York . These give this 1915 film an authenticity which is unusual in features of this vintage . The film begins with the modern day and a man ( George Beban in modern clothes ) reading a story about an Italian immigrant , and then we transition into the story with George playing the immigrant . He raises enough money to bring his fiancée from Italy to America , marries her , and has a son with her . But times are hard and the family struggles to survive . I found myself wondering why the mother did n't breastfeed her child , and avoid the complications with the dirty formula , but oh well , even the early Dream Factory was pushing political correct behaviour for women in 1915 ! The best scene in the picture is when Beban has a chance to seek revenge on a crime boss who inadvertently put him in jail , and at the last minute he decides against his planned course of action . Very neat . I loved the curtain effect , it was great . Wonderful use of lighting in this film . I give `` The Italian '' an 8 out of 10 ."
96,1,train,"Grey Gardens is a world unto itself . Edith and Little Edie live in near total isolation , eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their ( apparently ) shared bedroom . Cats loll about while mother Edith insults her daughter 's elocution . This is a Tennessee Williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights , as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100 % real . The situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50-ish daughter lived for a decade ( other than that they were poor and clean ) . They would bicker all day , grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men , work , and self-expression . This film is a must-see for anyone writing a mother/daughter relationship of this kind . It is sad and voyeuristic , but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly . It is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context -- remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion ."
97,1,train,The Movie I thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in between . Rob Stewart is a wonderful actor I do n't know why people keep giving him a bad rap . As for Mel Harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for Rob it 's only by five years . Rob had a lead role in his own TV series as well as one on the Scifi channel . I 'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane . He also starred in a number of TV movies and is now making a TV Mini series . They need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at .
98,1,train,"I started watching The Apprentice about 4 years ago ( maybe 5 ) and I really really liked it . The first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format , which though similar to a lot of other reality shows at its core , is still very entertaining . Donald Trump is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well . The casting coup with intelligent people having good looks being picked as contestants is appreciated as well . But the best part of the show is New York city . Mark Burnett may have made a lot of crap in his time but his handling of the cinematography is excellent as he makes NYC look like a character unto itself . The jazz tunes coupled with some great camera-work make New York look spectacular . The Apprentice will easily alway make my top 3 reality shows of all time ( The Amazing Race is no . 1 , however ) .But just like the amazing race this show is always best watched in moderation . If you keep watching it for a while the originality of the show will wear off fast ( the same case as with TAR ) .Star World , the broadcasters in this country , did a bang up job in presenting the show . The first three seasons were shown in a row , then after 2 years the next two seasons were shown , which kept the concept fresh . In conclusion , you will love this show , especially the first 2 seasons . However if you keep watching the show continuously , thereafter its charm WILL wear off and FAST ."
99,1,train,"This almost unknown gem was based on a French farce -- which shows , and I mean that as a compliment . Caroline ( Lee ) is being courted by a wealthy Argentinian ( Roland ) , who asks her father for her hand in marriage . But Caroline is already married to Anthony ( Colman ) , who has just arrived by plane and launches immediately into an audience-directed reminiscence about the last time Caroline decided she was in love with someone else : a dilettante-ish sculptor ( Gardiner ) . The film plays out the story of Anthony 's strategy in uncoupling Caroline from her sculptor , and how that experience aids him with her Argentinian . It is perfectly cast : Ronald Colman is at his most sophisticated and charming , Reginald Gardiner is at his most priggish , Gilbert Roland is at his most exotic , and Anna Lee is just deliciously whimsical . The film is wonderfully directed by Lewis Milestone ( who also produced ) ; the whole production feels like a labor of love . There are wonderful touches , such as Colman breaking frame and addressing the camera , and exceptional use of a sliding bar-cabinet door . It is a sin that it has n't been released on DVD -- this is the kind of film that can singlehandedly awaken interest in classic film ."
100,1,val,"Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those films that grabs you and does n't let go until the end , especially when you see it as a child . Seeing the film as an adult , you have to admit it is n't really all that scary , but the story is very fascinating and contains allot of great mysterious scenes ( especially the ones with the creepy mummy ) One of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new RV ; the scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary . Also the scenes where the main character discovers his mother 's secret is pretty frightening . Okay , the acting in the film is n't all that great and the film sometimes seems to get a little bit boring , but overall Ghosts That Still Walk is fun . Too bad only a few people saw this film , this film really deserves better . I just wan na say : Mr. Flocker , you 've done a good job ! And for all you Hollywood producers out there ; If you want to remake a movie , remake this one !"
101,1,train,"Simply the best Estonian film that I have ever seen , although it is made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi . Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold , a national treasure that belongs to the republic of Estonia . But at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time . In the early 90s Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries , such as Estonia , became independent . Now the conditions may be better in most of those countries . But in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as inheritance . ( And many of them still do ... at least on some level ... ) Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well-written script . The actors are also very good , especially Jüri Järvet ( perhaps the best known Estonian actor , plays Snaut in Tarkovski 's Solaris ) , playing and old gangster who 's slowly becoming tired of his way of life . But the most astonishing performance comes from Monika Mäger , a child-actor playing Terje , a boyish girl in her early teens , whose presence in the plot is quite essential . ( and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb-credit list ! ! ! ) w There are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time . But Tallinn Pimeduses does that . Unfortenately Järvi-Laturi 's other films are far from this kind of achievements . His first one , Kotia päin was too artificial and his latest , History is Made at Night was just a weird mess ."

The scene of the attack of Lawrence , Kansas is awesome . The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is outstanding as the bad guy . All the time this film makes you feel the horror of war , and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours . Definitely worth seeing ."
103,1,train,"This movie is definately one of my favourite movies in it 's kind . The interaction between respectable and morally uncorruptable characters is an ode to chivalry and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen . It treats themes like duty , guilt , word , manipulation and trust like few films have done and , unfortunately , none that I can recall since the death of the 'policial ' in the late seventies . The sequence is delicious , down to the essential , living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake . No such scenes are present or needed . The argument is flowless and honest to the spectator , wich is an important asset in a genre in wich the the suspense is often achieved through the betrail of the audience . No , this is not miss Marble ... A note of congratulations for the music is in order A film to watch and savour every minute , not just to see ."

This is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money . Unfortunately , the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently , tearing his life apart . There are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and , of course , the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time . The middle part is a bit dull , but the Faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer . One thing I have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie . Also , they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing . I first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it . I was not disappointed ."

She has been fighting the entire trust issue . This is also the first time I had seen her cry . After watching the film , I asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted .

If indeed this is also from a first-timer , as I read , I applaud the effort.Marvelous job then in that respect ! There were some comments about the music.I thought it was quite nice for the piece.Some say it kind of droned along for a while , but I found that created tension without ( us ) necessarily being conscious of it , and when he pulled the gun out and the guitar started crunching chords , it was like we knew there was a train on the tracks , but realize it is just now moving . Yes there is a 180 degree slip/clip in there , but shi* happens.Did anyone else see Hugh 's dirty shirt turn white ( near the end , in the rain ) in `` Australia '' ? Look how much money and people were behind that movie ! Give the kid a break for Gods sake ! All in all I think it was very well done . Only 2 things I would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning-Do n't walk up to a shiny brass picture frame with the camera , and I would have just displayed the splatter at the beginning shots to a still shot , so people would n't necessarily know what it is . My experience so far has taught me that it 's not that it 's hard to make a movie , it just takes time to learn how to do it , then the time to actually do it , and then you better take some more time still to think of all the details you 'll need to have shot before you call `` post-production time !

He presses charges , which arouses the kids ' ire , and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign . Marilyn Manson , er , Marlyn Mason rather , plays his fretful , boiled-celery wife , who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses , and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services . But The System is getting Culp nowhere , and he 's not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music . And we all know what movie people do when The System fails ... ( but this is based on a true story , which makes it even better ) . It should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient '70s funk-o-matic `` teenage '' theme music that warns us when they 're up to no good , this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even-handedly ( really ! ) . It does n't make a big generational thing out of it . Kudos for that . Anyway , if you like dogs ( or at least believe in protecting their civil rights , like me ) , and you like justice , and you like fire , and you like justice for dogs by way of fire , and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are `` too damn soft , '' then this flick 's ethos is up your alley . No , it 's not really `` good , '' at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word . There 's nothing subtle or understated or clever about it , it 's just sort of a feature-length PSA for vigilantism .

Remember that scene in A Christmas Story where the kid pounds the bully 's face in ? Remember how cool that was ? Or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors ? Yeah , mon .

Neighborhood hoodlums in New York sell drugs and run scams because they ca n't make it in the legitimate world , maybe because they have a criminal record , or a drug habit , or because they 're just lazy . This simple story with a couple of twists about mostly despicable characters manages to draw compassion out of the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other . The film is written , produced , and directed by Laurence Fishburne , who also stars as 20/20 Mike ( all hoodlums have nicknames ) , and is based on his play , ` Riff Raff . ' It feels like a play from beginning to end , especially during the longest scene where the three main players square off to decide who can be trusted . Often times the dialog comes very fast , much faster than it would on stage , and I think it 's the film 's biggest flaw . Mixed in as flashbacks throughout the film are poems from the street , a sort of iambic pentameter rap , that is violent and evocative of the world this movie discloses . The poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men , these hoodlums who murder , cheat , and betray each other , as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt . The disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live , but how they suffer for the same reasons as us all . One is too stupid , another a junkie , and the last suffers from conscience while the audience wonders , or even laughs , at the irony of executioners demanding from him hanging in the gallows to tell jokes in the midst of his demise ."
119,1,train,"OK , I did n't know what to expect when I saw the cover to Fido , honestly when I came across it in the video store I was tempted to rent this movie , but nothing about it really grabbed my attention . But when I was looking around in Netflix , they were advertising this like crazy if I liked `` goofy '' scary movies , so I figured to just give it a shot . I 'm so glad that I did watch it , this was just a great movie , it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch . Like I said , it 's Pleasantville meets Night of the Living Dead , it 's just a great concept , what does happen after a mega zombie attack ? As we see in another zombie comedy , Shaun of the Dead , they have fun by making the zombies left over as `` handy '' citizens . This is a very overlooked horror/comedy movie , I think a lot of people were just so blown away with Shaun of the Dead that this got the boot . But it 's a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie . In a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies . This radiation still plagues humanity , as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead . In order to continue living normal lives , communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named Zomcon . Zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies ' hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants . In the town of Willard , a housewife , Helen , buys a zombie in spite of her husband Bill 's zombie phobia . Their son , Timmy , befriends the zombie , naming him `` Fido '' . One day Fido 's collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor , who turns into a zombie . Timmy `` kills '' the zombified neighbor . When a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor , they capture Fido and Timmy . Helen comes and rescues Timmy and Fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing . Several days later , the neighbor 's body is found and the murder is traced back to Fido , who is taken away to Zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed . Timmy learns through a friend that Fido is simply working in a factory at Zomcon . Timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get Fido back . I really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it , it 's so silly but a lot of fun . Billy Connelly did a great job as Fido and really brought , no pun intended , a lot of life into the character . I think the scene that made me laugh the most was when Timmy has to burry the old lady that Fido attacked and killed , his last words to her were so funny , `` you were n't really nice , but you liked flowers , so '' and he buries her in the garden . Not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend , sick , disturbing , wrong , but classic laughs . I still love how even though this is like the Leave It To Beaver-esquire type of world , there still is a lot of gore in the movie . So if you do have a chance to see Fido , take it , I promise some good laughs . 9/10"
120,1,val,"Serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction . Known as `` chapter plays , '' they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called `` chapters '' or `` episodes . '' Each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week . The serial would end with a cliffhanger , as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape . The audience would have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again . Serials were especially popular with children , and for many children in the first half of the 20th century , a typical Saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial , along with animated cartoons , newsreels , and two feature films . The golden age for serials was 1936-1945 . This was one of the best of the era . Zorro has been seen in many films , but Reed Hadley ( `` Racket Squad '' , The Undying Brain ) was excellent in the role . The action is constant , and we are led chapter by chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the evildoer . Zorro triumphs , as he always does ."

Pegg 's and Dunst 's ) reflection on how events were affecting them and what had led them to where they now found themselves .

123,1,train,"Firstly , I have heard great things about this film , not least among the retro/vintage scene and the stockings lovers who absolutely love Bettie Page and it did not disappoint . Shot in very clean black and white with colour added for key scenes , the film gives a documentary feel to the early life and career of Bettie Page . There are many things I did not know about Page . Firstly , there was the gang rape , later on , there is her early attempts at developing an acting career and then glamour pictures , firstly with a camera club peopled with men who ca n't get enough of her and later with the Klaws , Paula and Irving , who despite their taking of bondage and fetish photos , come across as extremely pleasant and friendly people . If only modern pornography producers were like that , perhaps better porn would be a consequence ! For the most part , the film is neither a diatribe against the evils of pornography but an attempt to show the kind of environment that existed in the 1950s for those producing fetish and nude pictures of women . This environment was extremely repressive , perhaps in a good way because it meant that there was none of the 'saturation ' effect that we have today , when it comes to pornography . It also appeared to be much less harsh . Page comes across as someone who enjoys her work and does n't appear to be degraded by it . In many of her photos she is seen tied up and gagged ( and trying to hold a conversation ) , brandishing a whip with a flourish , thus exciting the photographers taking her pictures and seen in 'initiation style ' girlie bondage movies which look quite tame compared with the hardcore stuff we have now . Page never became an actress and instead deserted pinup when she was in her thirties for 'Jesus Christ ' . Her belief in God and Jesus never goes away , even when bound and gagged she still insists that she has been given a 'gift ' by God to do 'this thing ' . Seeing this film , I am more knowledgeable about Page and in awe at her modesty , beliefs and demeanour .

124,1,train,"I LOVE this movie . Director Michael Powell once stated that this was his favorite movie , and it is mine as well . Powell and Pressburger created a seemingly simple , superbly crafted story - the power of love against `` the powers that be '' . However , its deception lies in the complexity of its `` is it real or is it imaginary '' premise . Basically , one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young , poetically inclined airman during WWII . Or is it ? The question is never answered one way or the other . Actually , it is never even asked . This continuous understatement is part of the film 's appeal . The innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers . For instance , Pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of Richard Strauss ' opera , Der Rosenkavalier , about a young 18th century Viennese aristocrat . This is evident in the brief interlude in which Conductor 71 , dressed in all his finery , holds the rose ( which appears silver in heaven ) . The music even has a dreamy quality . All of the acting is first rate - David Niven is at his most charming , and he has excellent support from veteran Roger Livesey and relative newcomer Kim Hunter . But , in my opinion , the film 's charm comes from Marius Goring as Conductor 71 . He by far has the most interesting role , filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness , brightening the film . It 's a pity that some of Conductor 71 's scenes were left on the cutting room floor . It is also a pity that Goring 's comedic talents are rarely seen again on film , except in the wonderful videos of The Scarlet Pimpernel television series from the 1950s . This is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career . He is a perfect foil for relaxed style of Niven , and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters . Ironically , also in the mid -1940s , Niven also starred against another heavenly `` messenger '' , played by Cary Grant , in The Bishop 's Wife . Their acting styles were so similar that I found the result boring , unenergetic , and disappointing . As a note , according to Powell , Goring desperately wanted the role of Peter Carter , initially refusing Conductor 71 . It 's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal . The movie , `` commissioned '' to smooth over the strained relations between Britain and the U.S. , overdrives its point towards the end . But it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war - the numerous casualties , both military and civilian , the need to `` go on '' when faced with death . There is a conspicuous lack of WWII `` enemies '' in heaven , but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin . Powell and Pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it was n't necessary . The movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for , but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the Atlantic ."
125,1,train,"Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this , the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films . This lush , trashy saga is a masterpiece , beautifully combining all of the elements of Sirk 's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie . `` Written on the Wind '' very obviously influenced the 1980s TV series `` Dallas '' and `` Dynasty '' , as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps . Lauren Bacall , wonderfully and subtly , plays Lucy Moore , a New York City secretary who marries oil baron , Kyle Hadley ( Robert Stack ) . Unbeknownst to both of them , Mitch Wayne ( Rock Hudson ) is also in love with the quiet , but sexy secretary . They all go back to Kyle 's family 's mansion in Texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister , Marylee ( Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn ) . Yipee ! The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights , this is a campy trip . Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend 's wife , but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she ca n't have her one true love who is Mitch . Topping it all off , Kyle learns he 's impotent , but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant . This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment . How can you not love it ? This film signals one of Universal 's most popular films and one of director Sirk 's best works . Some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is great . The cast is great , although Bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson . Stack 's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him . He considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out . And he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic . What a stunning movie ! This film proves what I 've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama . Where 's his Oscar ?"

Not only is it revolutionary in its narration , but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians . Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindström are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in Sweden today , and this film really puts that on display . `` Vuxna människor '' ( Adult People ) is a warm-hearted and hilarious story about adulthood , and the question if we wouldn´t be better off without it ."
127,1,train,"At times , this overtakes The Thing as my favourite horror film . While Carpenter 's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick , Kubrick 's is more artistic , more thought-provoking , and probably scarier . It 's one of the few films where I can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it . I try not to compare it to the book  which I 've only read once , a number of years ago , and which scared me to death  because the two do n't have a lot in common , besides the story and characters obviously . It 's almost as if Kubrick was banking on people 's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening . And it that way , it 's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made , as well as one of the greatest horror films . What makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares , not the blood and gore , not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time . It 's the destruction of Jack Torrence . Some people have complained about the casting of Nicholson in this role , saying that it 's too obvious that he 's going to go crazy in the film , given his past roles and his appearance . I disagree . We know he 's going to go crazy  since most of us have read the book  and Jack 's appearance only furthers this notion . But it 's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared . He 's calm , quiet , patient . He engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family . And with a wife and son as irritating as his , it 's a small wonder that he manages to do so . But once he gets to the Overlook , he changes . He becomes irritable , angry , on edge . The scene that always shocks me is when Wendy interrupts him typing , and he utterly loses it , telling her to `` leave him the f*** alone '' . This is the first f-bomb dropped in the film , and it 's a shock to the system . From then on , all bets are off . Another thing I love is the multiple interpretations present in the film . We 're never really sure if what we 're seeing is actually happening . Many critics have noted that whenever Jack talks to a ghost , there 's a mirror present , showing that he may as well be talking to himself . But what of the other characters ? Wendy never sees anything until the film 's climax , until she is given a tour of the hotel 's many ghostly inhabitants , but she is well aware that something is wrong , while Danny connects with the place almost immediately . His psychic powers are not in question  how else would Hallorann know to come to the hotel ?  but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness ? It 's easy to claim that Jack merely loses it , being trapped in a hotel with his family , and Wendy later does as well  seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that  but what of Danny ? It appears that his body is taken over by Tony , but how do we know for sure ? None of these characters are reliable witnesses . Hallorann probably would be , and he warns of the dangers in 237 , but he 's killed as soon as he arrives at the Overlook ( a scare Kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel ) . And that final shot . Has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema ? Has Jack really been there before ? Or was his body merely 'absorbed ' into the hotel ? When talking about the acting in this film , any discussion begins and ends with Jack Nicholson . Shelley Duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history  probably on purpose , to give Jack 's character more of a reason to snap  and Danny Lloyd is no better , but Jack is a powerhouse . Part method , part improvisation , he 's simultaneously terrifying and appealing . For better or for worse , he 's the character with whom we identify with , not the annoying kid or nagging wife . We all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season , be able to do whatever we want . Who cares if it 's haunted ? Of course , the technical aspects are terrific . Kubrick 's long takes , strange angles , and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror . The use of colour , mirrors , long hallways , and every other motif only heightens this . And do n't even get me started on that score . I do n't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting , electronic tune . Its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel , the mood , and the entire film itself . I know King does n't like this film , but King 's input on cinema is nothing to brag about . As great of a novel writer he may be , his screenplays are terrible , and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed . This is not a very faithful book adaptation , but it does n't need to be , and it really should n't . Part of the horror of the film is that the viewer does n't have the book to fall back on ; there 's no reassuring source material . Kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more . If only for that , this is one of the most innovative films in any genre . And it 's got everything else on top of that ."
128,1,train,"One of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from Atlanta . The idea of living the Chulawasse river before it 's turned into a lake comes from Burt Reynold 's Lewis , who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare . But if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie , the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story , with our men forced to make a decision that ( they know ) will change their lives forever . In very bad ways . At the end of the movie , each person is gon na be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week-end on the river but muted into a fight for survival . The movie ( except some pretty evident goofs ) is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath . The photography is excellent as well . Voight , Reynolds , Cox and Beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake ."

It 's rare that a film entertains the kids for so long , and offers laughs for the adults , too . Most enjoy it more than the first .

The film clips in this documentary from the war does n't miss out anything , some of the clips left me dumbstuck . The whole series is over 20 episodes long , and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war . Simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still , and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch .

And yes , the movie has many flaws , but what movie does n't ? There are many good scenes and good acting by Tom Berenger . I have to say the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with Billy Zane in the Helicopter followed by Zane in the Marine 's bar scene . The best scene in Sniper is with Berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force sweeping it ! !

143,1,train,"In Iran women are prohibited from attending live sporting events because of the fear that they will be `` corrupted '' by bad language , close proximity to thousands of men , and the fact that there are no toilet facilities for women in the antiquated stadiums . Based on an actual incident involving the daughter of the director , Jafar Panahi 's Offside follows six girls , disguised as men , who are refused entry into the soccer match in 2005 between Iran and Bahrain , a match that will decide whether or not Iran goes to the World Cup . In a departure from the bleak , minimalist films we have been accustomed to from Iran over the last ten years , Offside is an exuberant comedy that has a patriotic fervor and a universal appeal but contains enough subversive social commentary to warrant its prohibition from screenings in Iran . Shot with a digital camera using non-professional actors who are more than up to the task , the girls try to sneak into Azadi Stadium in Tehran but are arrested and placed in a holding area outside of the stadium . They are guarded by three young army conscripts ( Safdar Samandar , Mohammed Kheir-abadi , and Masoud Kheymeh-kaboud ) who express ambivalence about their task but are pledged to follow the rules . The women are soccer enthusiasts , not political activists and cheer for Iran 's victory but this does not deter the soldiers from detaining them while they wait for the girls to be transported to the Vice Squad and an uncertain future . Outspoken rather than acting like victims , they continually question the soldiers about the rationale behind the restrictions , making their absurdity quite obvious . Although they can hear the crowd noise , the women can not see the action but achieve a minor victory when they persuade one of the soldiers to provide a running commentary on the game . One of the funniest sequences takes place when a female `` prisoner '' is escorted to the men 's room by a soldier . The young recruit then must cope with a near riot when he has to prevent anyone else from using the facilities while the girl is still inside . Little by little , to paraphrase Adlai Stevenson , that which unites them turns out to be greater than that which divides them and the unlikely antagonists rally behind their country and root for the victory that will send Iran to the World Cup . Although the point is made early and often and the film sags a bit in the middle , Offside makes a telling point about a society where a political elite with a medieval social mentality has to contend with an growing group of educated and politically astute citizens . One can only hope that world pressure and the awakening of its own people will force the Ayatollahs to come to terms with the 21st century ."

( Dir : Patrick Stettner ) Hitchcockian suspenser gives Williams a stand-out low-key performance . What is it about celebrities and fans ? What is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm ? In the latest derange fan scenario , based on true events no less , Williams stars as a talk-radio personality named Gabriel No one , who reads stories he 's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand ( Culkin ) who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to No one 's editor Ashe ( Morton ) who gives it to No one to read for himself . No one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of Pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna ( Collette giving an excellent performance ) who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with No one reveals that Pete is dying from AIDS . Naturally No one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess ( Cannavale ) whose sudden departure from their New York City apartment has No one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into Donna and Pete 's backgrounds discovering some truths that he did n't anticipate . Written by Armistead Maupin ( who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover Terry Anderson and the film 's novice director Stettner ) and based on a true story about a fan 's hoax found out has some Hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does . It helps that Williams gives a stand-out , low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him ( the one thing that has escaped his own reality ) and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy Collette whose one physical trait I will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core . However the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by Stettner , it pays to listen to your own inner voice : be careful of what you hope for ."
150,1,train,"Released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion with Agniezska Holland 's own Holocaust film Europa Europa , this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise , inspire or downright shock is a bizarre , nostalgic , elaborate film about a naive American in Germany shortly following the end of WWII . The American , named Leo , does n't fully get what he 's doing there . He has come to take part in fixing up the country since , in his mind , it 's about time Germany was shown some charity . No matter how that sounds , he is not a Nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro-German , merely mixed up . His uncle , who works on the railroad , gets Leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car , and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germany 's horrors and enigmas . This progression starts when Leo , played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor Jean-Marc Barr , meets a sultry heiress on the train played by Barbara Sukowa , an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor . She seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family , which owns the company which manufactures the trains . These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war , but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable , and the woman 's Uncle Kessler postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs . There is also Udo Kier , the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier 's shocking second film Epidemic , though here he is mere scenery . Another guest at the house is Eddie Constantine , an actor with a quiet strength , playing a somber American intelligence man . He can confirm that Uncle Kessler was a war criminal , though it is all completely baffling to Leo . Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades , but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than Leo , who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train . The story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film 's Danish director , Lars Von Trier , whose anchor is in the film 's breathtaking editing and cinematography . He shoots in black and white and color , he uses double-exposures , optical effects and trick photography , having actors interact with rear-projected footage , he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects , caught between glass for our more precise survey . This Grand Jury Prize-winning surrealist work is allegorical , but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer . I interpret it as a film about the last legs of Nazism , symbolized by the train , and the ethical accountability of Americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads . During the time frame of the movie , and the Nazi state , and such significance to the train , are dead , but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes . The characters , music , dialogue , and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions . The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones . Two trains halting back and forth , Barr on one and Sukowa on another . An underwater shot of proliferating blood . An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown . And most metaphysically affecting of all , an anesthetic shot of train tracks , as Max von Sydow 's voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him , and abandon our personal restraint ."

He quickly discovers he 's invisible ... so the predictable results occur , meaning he uses his new hidden condition to torment Tom . Jerry often is just defending himself , but often he has sadistic streak in him that torments the cat whenever possible , even when unprovoked . Here , he makes Tom think his eyes are deceiving him when cheese from a mousetrap disappears before his eyes , or milk from a dish . Tom ca n't take anymore so he tries to sleep this nightmare off , but Jerry sets fire to his paw ! Man , I hope little kids did n't ideas watching these cartoons back in the '40s and '50s ! I always found Jerry , the little mouse , more evil than cute . Thankfully , in cartoons , generally , whatever damage a character suffers is gone within seconds and he 's back to normal . The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way through when Tom figures out what the story is with Jerry , and tries different methods to detect where the mouse is located ( such as putting flour on the floor to see his footprints ) ."
152,1,train,"`` The Bourne Ultimatum '' begins recklessly mid-chase and in pulse-pounding fashion explodes from there as Jason Bourne ( Matt Damon , absolutely superb ) tracks down the masterminds behind the CIA black-ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity . A devastatingly icy David Strathairn as the `` man behind the curtain '' is added to the returning cast of regulars including Joan Allen ( excellent ) and Julia Stiles ( non-existent ) . Like the second entry in the series , I wished Paul Greengrass ' shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime . However , that being said , it 's a perfect way to capture the tense , claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand-combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile-up . Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities . The Bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic . It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time , but I 'll be damned if it is n't a blast to watch them get there . With the absence of the emotive and involving Franka Potente , the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between Damon and Stiles , but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything . Still , this can be forgiven , for unlike the `` Identity '' and the `` Supremacy '' , this `` Ultimatum '' reveals all and we finally learn the truth about Bourne 's past . It 's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series , and if they have any good sense , and Damon gets his wish , this will be the perfect end to it ."

It turns out , the mother goes home to die , and she is left with her grandfather . She also makes friends and experiences much in a short time . Tomiche ( Juan Jose Ballestra ) is at first a nuisance to her then they become close . The film is shot beautifully , bathed in soft colors mostly . Carol yearns for her dad , who is a pilot in the war , and you can feel the love sher has for him . While the war itself is kind of taken a back seat in this film , it envelops the character 's lives . I think you 'll like it . See it especially for Clara Lago , who does a great job as Carol . She is definitely one to watch ."

American actor Ron Livington stars in the film alongside newcomer Thuy Nguyen , a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly , and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in Cambodia . Although it tackles a heavy topic , the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close , keeping the two-hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch . I am glad a film like this is bringing the world 's attention to the problem . Child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step . It 's GREAT and a film EVERYONE must see ."

I initially was not too keen to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards India and Pakistan . I was so totally wrong . Pinjar is a heart-wrenching , emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws . I was haunted by it after watching it . It lingered on my mind for so long ; the themes , the pain , the loss , the emotion- all was so real . This is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in Bollywood nowadays . It has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story . Here , no one country is depicted as good or bad . There are evil Indians , evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis . The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious , meaningful ( thanks to Gulzar sahib ) and haunting . Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the acting just took my breath away . All were perfectly cast . If you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie ... look no further . This movie gives it all . I recommend it with all my heart .

To the contrary , the master of ELEPHANT WALK , John Wiley ( Peter Finch ) , complains that he can not shoot any of the pachyderms -- no matter how menacing -- without a permit from the government ( and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability ) . Furthermore , the elements conspire -- in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic -- to leave the Wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the Elephant People ( as the natives dub them ) to close the story .

I ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy , Halloween parties , sassy humor , and some sexy evil displayed by Elvira . They just do n't make movies like this anymore ... It had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show host style . The truth is that it generated plenty of fans because of it 's humor and the ability to perform by Cassandra . This is classic that reminds me of the good days of USA Up All Night ."

It 's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick , full of fun , laughter , heartbreak , and with a little drama to keep you on your toes . A true family film , Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave pets , who set out to cross the Rocky Mountains in an attempt to find their owners , following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way . One of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the voice acting is that good . Shadow is a wonderful character , old , wise and brave , and watching him trying to save Sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment . Chance - who would n't love a dog like Chance ? He 's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen . And Sassy is very witty for a cat - she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper ; 'Here kitty kitty kitty ... not on your life , chubby . ' There were also lots of well made emotional scenes , such as Sassy going over the waterfall ( I was truly scared for her ) , Shadow falling in the ditch ( almost in tears ) and then the fantastic ending , when all three pets return home ... including good old Shadow !

161,1,train,"If you 're a fan of film noir and think they do n't make 'em like they used to , here is your answer -they just do n't make 'em in Hollywood anymore . We must turn to the French to remember how satisfying , subtle and terrific a well-made film from that genre can be . Read My Lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director Jacques Audiard , featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel . The basic plot could have been written in the 40 's : dumb but appealing ex-con and a smart but dowdy femme fatale ( who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious ) discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing , manipulate each other to meet their own ends , develop complex love/hate relationship , cook up criminal scheme involving heist , double crosses , close calls and lots of money . All action takes place in depressing , seedy and/or poorly lit locations . Audiard has fashioned some modern twists , of course . The femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her . And where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature . Add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film , but make no mistake - this is old school film noir . It 's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films I 've seen all year ."

164,1,train,"This film is available from David Shepard and Kino on the Before Hollywood There Was Fort Lee , NJ , although that is a shortened version with just the `` behind-the-scenes movie sections . I 'm not sure if Blackhawk Films only had a film print of these parts , or they edited out the other scenes . The original Blackhawk version was retitled A Movie Romance . The complete feature does survive , but the preprint for this version had some nitrate decomposition , and a couple of sections looked bad , so that may be why Blackhawk 's version was edited . Directed by Maurice Tourneur , the film has Tourneur playing himself , or more likely a caricature of himself . Supposedly , director Emile Chautard and future director Joseph von Sternberg also can be spotted . Country lass Mary ( Doris Kenyon ) longs for a romantic man to sweep her off her feet . She dreams of a troubadour that will woo her , but is constantly interrupted by the only available local boy , Johnny Applebloom . Meanwhile , a film company from New York ( actually New Jersey ) is filming a western in the countryside . Mary sees an Indian ( in full headdress ) and raises an alarm -- spoiling a scene that the movie company is filming . She is immediately attracted to the dashing film star Kenneth Driscoll ( Robert Warwick ) . He encourages her to leave her home and try to become an actress in the big city . When she arrives at the studio , she discovers that everything about the movies is fake . The doors and walls are just flats that are hastily assembled for the set . That lanky walk of the western hero or the happy skip of the heroine are just acting too . The sets are on a big revolving stage , so the angle of the sun can even be manipulated . The black attendant at the studio signs all the movie stars ' `` autographed '' photos . The signs on the wall say `` Positively No Smoking '' , but everybody smokes anyway . Even the titles of the film ( which are illustrated nicely ) emphasize everything fake about the movie-making life . Movie star Driscoll is just as disenchanted with the ho-hum of everyday film-making . He makes a temporary split from girlfriend Vivian ( June Elvidge ) to pursue this `` exciting '' country girl . His plans are dashed when Mary 's screen-test is a stinker . We do n't get to see the actual film , but only the audience 's pained reactions to it . Mary is devastated , but she does n't want to admit to everyone back home that she was a failure , so she continues to see Driscoll and we she has lunch with him in the studio cafeteria along with other extras dressed as policemen , soldiers , cowboys , etc . Mary decides to stay with Driscoll . At a party with their movie `` friends '' , she agrees to marry him although there is not much love between them . Surprisingly , her mother appears , with a cake especially for Mary 's birthday . This causes Mary to re-evaluate her future . This film has all kinds of fascinating scenes of studios , movie sets , dressing rooms , editing rooms , etc . If you 've always wondered what went on behind the scenes when a silent film was being made , this movie peeks behind the curtain ."
165,1,train,"Peter Jacksons version ( s ) are better films overall from objective point of view . That being said , they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord Of The Rings , and let me explain why . Firstly , the acting of the on-screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with Jackson 's LOTR . The whole cast is too run of the mill . `` Are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi version are better actors than real people ? '' one could ask . Well , they are not really silly ( save for Hobbits , later about them ) and they certainly pack more personality than Jackson 's party - even with much more limited dialogue time . And that is because of superior _voice_ acting of the Bakshi 's LOTR . Take Aragorn for example . In this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority ( Aragorn the lord ) and with a seasoned rasp ( Aragorn the ranger ) . This is due to John Hurt 's brilliant voice acting . Compare that to Viggo Mortensen 's rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven : Hurt beats Mortensen hands down . And then there is Gandalf . Probably the most dominating ( and the most popular ) character in the whole saga . In this Bakshi version Gandalf ( William Squire ) is a real wizard . And by that I do n't mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips ( he does not ) , but his presence is just captivating . He is a mystical , powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease . Add to that his looks : Tall , old as the ancient oak , beard long as his body , sharp eyes , wizardy hook nose and of course , the classical wizard hat . A Perfect Gandalf , just like in the books . Ian McKellen 's Gandalf in the other hand , is simply just too boring . He looks too human , sounds too human , acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword . Yes a sword . In this Bakshi version Gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword ( as he did in the books ) . And those are stylish slow motion kills . Gandalf is not a power to be messed with . And it must be noted , that while I 'm sad to say this , the great Christopher Lee did n't bring Saruman alive . Fraser Kerr in this movie did , even with a very limited screen time and lines . Before I move completely to visual aspects of the movie , it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the Orcs are also superior to Jackson 's pretendeous bad guys . Bakshi 's orcs taunt their enemies ( or each other ) constantly with growls , screams and nasty language . They are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion . And finally , the Black Riders - or the Nazgul . Those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one - not just some riders wearing black . And they speak with haunting voice , which mesmerizes their victim . My favorite scene in the film is when the Nazgul are chasing Frodo near the river . While Peter Jackson could n't do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party , Bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky . But as much I like this film more than Jackson 's , the latter are , if only technically , still better . And that is because of some key visuals . As you know Bakshi LOTR features a mixture of animated characters ( all hobbits and the main cast ) and real actors covered with paint . I do n't really have a problem using real people in animation this way , but they just do n't fit very well with traditional cartoon figures . This is especially true with humans ( Riders of Rohan , tavern people etc . ) Orcs are different matter , since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters . Orcs , while played by humans with animation mix , look far superior to Jacksons version . They have brownish-green skin , shiny red eyes , flat face and pointed teeth . Biggest screw up in this films visuals , howerver , are the Hobbits . While I prefer almost every character in Bakshi version compared to Jackson , the latter has clearly superior Hobbits , in fact they are perfect . With Bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid Disney bambies . And you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them , so be warned . Again , the voice acting is OK with them too , but the actors mouths can not save the `` immersion damage '' made by these little weasels . Well , I never really liked those halflings anyway . General failures in the Bakshi script are well known . Limited playing time ( with limited budget ) and a lot of missing scenes . So while this film covers nearly half of the story , it does n't do it in extensive detail compared to Jackson 's version . In a summary the Ralph Bakshi version of LOTR has a superior : -overall atmosphere ( it feels more like Middle-Earth ) -overall voice acting -music ( I really dig the fantasy score by Kont & Rosenman ) -Gandalf -Aragorn ( One of the John Hurt 's finest roles ) -King Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond ( He 's not some fairy hippie in this one ! ) While Jackson version is better : -because it covers the whole story -overall visuals and special effects -Gollum/Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi , even with it 's well known shortcomings , is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of Tolkien 's fantasy world very well , if not perfectly . I 'll give it a score of 8½ out of 10 ."
166,1,train,"I saw `` Brother 's Shadow '' at the Tribeca Film Festival and found myself still thinking about it two days later . The story of a prodigal son ( Scott Cohen ) returning to his family 's custom furniture business after a stint in jail , it offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama -- memorable characters ; sharp , observant dialog ; sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visually . But more than that , it presents something that is all too rare at the multiplex these days : the uncompromising vision of a mature sensibility . The talent of director-screenwriter Todd S. Yellin seems to emerge full-blown , but we get the sense he ( like his protagonist ) has paid his dues . He knows how real people struggle in this world , and he knows how we yearn to see -- or at least , to experience vicariously -- success . Yet Yellin respects his audience too much to blow happy smoke up our rear ends . In the end , we see that Jake 's triumph does n't lie in commissions , or even in the esteem of his family , but in `` the work '' he could n't abandon if he tried . It 's an essential theme in a world ( and especially a movie industry ) that ca n't rise above `` the bottom line '' . This film deserves a wide audience ."
167,1,train,"This is very much not the sort of movie for which John Wayne is known . He plays a diplomat , a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action . The film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story . For the open-minded , the patient and the thoughtful , this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of history . There are two intertwining stories . The big story is of internalised , isolationist Japan and externalised , expansionist America clashing when their interests conflict . The small , human , story is of an outsider barbarian ( Wayne ) and a civilised Geisha 's initial hostility and dislike turning to mutual respect and love . The human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations . The movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well . The two lead roles are performed to perfection . John Wayne is excellent as Townsend Harris , striking exactly the right blend of force and negotiation in his dealings with the Japanese . Eiko Ando is likewise excellent as the Geisha of the title , charming and delightful . The interaction between her character and John Wayne 's is particularly well portrayed . This is exactly how these two individuals ( as they are depicted in the film ) would have behaved . The script is very well written . It lacks all pomposity . and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred . The characters are real people , not self-consciously `` great '' figures from history . Furthermore , the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety . Indeed , the clash of a traditionalist , and traditionally powerful , isolationist Japan and a rising , newly powerful nation from across the ocean is summarised very well in one exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron . Wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in Japan , and that passing ships can not even put into port for water . The Baron responds that Japan just wants to be left alone . Wayne 's character replies that Japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping , and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of brigands infesting an important roadway . A very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right , and saw the other as being in the wrong . The resultant clash between two self-righteous peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history , a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the future . Cinematography and the depiction of mid-nineteenth century Japan , before the accelerated growth towards industrialisation that was to follow later in the century , is excellent . A visual treat , and an enlightening insight into Japan 's ancient civilisation . I highly recommend anyone , whether a John Wayne fan or not , to watch this film if you get the chance . Just be aware that it is n't an action film . It is a representation of an interesting place and time in history , and a slow-boiling love story which ( much to their surprise ) comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters . Watch this film on its merits , without preconceptions , allow yourself to be immersed in its story , and you will thoroughly enjoy it . All in all , an excellent film ."

The two main characters , Eric and Donna , are two teenagers living next door to each other . They have been living next door to each other for most of their lives , and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season . A large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working . Two other characters , Red and Kitty , are Eric 's parents . Red was in the service , so he really pushes Eric around . Kitty is just the opposite . Even though she drinks heavily , she treats Eric and his friends with a lot of care . Bob , their neighbor , is obviously Donna 's Dad . Bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show 's story . Bob also annoys Red to his full extent .

This is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other . The First Season is original , funny , and enjoyable . The Second Season is good , although it is n't as good as the first . It is a basic continuation of the First . Eric and Donna are together , and everything is working out great . The Third Season is my favorite . It went back and captured the First Season feel and humor . I also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch , making the show all that more fun to watch . The Fourth Season is n't near as good . Eric and Donna Arne't together in this one , making the show slightly less pleasurable . It is still funny , although I did n't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons . The Fifth Season is the last season I enjoyed all the way through . It is the gang 's Senior Year , so that really helps with the story . The Fifth Season also had the best ending out of all the seasons . The Sixth Season is good for the most part . It is extremely funny , although it does n't capture the feel that the other seasons did . The gang is out of High School , so I believe that it did n't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did . I also did n't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them . The Seventh Season captures the same feel that the 5th season had in a way , although it did n't do it all the way . I enjoyed the Seventh Season as I did all the others , and the ending is great . The Last Season flat out sucked . Eric was n't in it , which ruined it . Kelso was n't in it for the most part either , which did n't help . I hated the Eighth Season up until the last episode . I thought that the last episode was really good , and a fitting ending to the series . So overall , if you enjoy comedy , give That 70s Show a try . They stopped making new episodes , but it is still on TV a bunch . I also recommend buying Seasons 1-7 . It is up to you if you want to buy Season 8 ."
176,1,train,"Of those comments here before mine , I mostly agree with Edyarb 's . The story and the script apparently had potential to be funny , but though managing at some points , in other places it failed . You could see them wanting to make a joke , but no one in the audience laughed . ( Also agree with Edyarb 's view on the end credits : leave it normal or make it cool , but not what they 've done now . ) OK , that gives a more negative feeling than what I actually had watching the movie . I enjoyed it ; it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely did n't feel like a waste of money to get the ticket . The best jokes are the ones that go a little bit outside of the expected and are fairly mature , like Luke Wilson 's character Matt asking the super chick `` P*nis or bed ? '' when she told him she 'd `` get him a new one '' after a wild night in bed , ending up breaking the bed and leaving Matt sore . I can not , however , agree with bgs1614 , who says that the film could earn an ' R ' rating - there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that . Some sexual acts yes , but nothing explicit , only humorous , and no nudity whatsoever . ( Maybe he was at a prescreening that showed more ... ? ) I 'd like to compare this to two recent films I went to see with no expectations whatsoever : Superman Returns and Click . I did n't really expect anything from either one - I was a big fan of the original Superman films and the trailer for Click only showed it as a potentially chauvinistic ( which I would n't oppose ) film . Superman surprised me with actually having me feel good ( goosebumps ! ) about seeing his first heroic deed , like seeing a long lost friend and feeling happy about it . But for the rest of the story I 'd rather watch My Super Ex-girlfriend , at least it offers some surprises . Click again was a TOTAL surprise , much better and deeper than the trailer and about five minutes away from being a really excellent movie . The jokes also work much better than in Ex-girlfriend , both the naughty ones and the more advanced ones . Anyway , the only reason I compared these three films is that they are the three last ones I 've seen , within a very short period , and also because I went to all of these with basically no expectations at all . I 'd rank them Click , Girlfriend , Superman ."

182,1,train,"I enjoyed this film . It was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of Peter O'Donnell . A number of people have disliked the film , but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is . The film uses flashback to show the young Modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became . Before the Network . Before Willie Garvin . The pace is a trifle slow , and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes . However this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version . If you like Modesty Blaise , you will enjoy it even with its faults , if you just want an action flick with car chases - forget it . It has the feeling of being the first of a franchise , but as I have never seen it promoted anywhere , I suspect there will be no more to follow . Sadly ."

Yes , sure , like the TV show THE FBI , this is an obvious case of the Bureau doing some PR work to try to drum up support . But , as entertainment goes , it does a good job . Plus , surprisingly enough for the time it was made , the film focuses more on crime than espionage and `` Commies '' . Instead , it 's a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose . Now considering the agent is played by Jimmy Stewart , then it 's pretty certain the acting and writing were good -- as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who was n't about to waste the star in a third-rate flick . So overall , it 's worth seeing but not especially great ."
185,1,train,"I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound , the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location . But no problem - it 's still a much underrated lovely composition from Marcel Carne . The plot seems a bit choppy at times , as if they were making it up as they went along , but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end . The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue , but it 's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted . Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots ? Suicide pacts are fairly common ; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools ?

186,1,train,"When I first heard about the show , I heard a lot about it , and it was getting some good reviews . I watched the first episode of this `` forensic fairy tale '' , as it so proclaims itself , and I really got hooked on it . I have loved it since . This show has a good sense of humour and it 's fun to see a good show like this . The cast is excellent as their characters , and I would n't want to change them in any way . For those unfamiliar with this show , Pushing Daisies centers around a man named Ned ( aka The Pie Maker , played by Lee Pace ) who discovered a special gift when he was a boy : He could bring the dead back to life with the touch of a finger . He first did so with his dog , Digby . However , there is the catch : If he keeps a dead person alive for more than one minute , someone else dies . He learned this when he brought his mother back to life , and his childhood crush 's father died in Ned 's mother 's place . The other catch is if he touches the person again , they 're dead again , but this time for good . He learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight . His father took him to boarding school , and when he left , Ned never saw his father again . Almost 20 years later , Ned owns a pie bakery , cleverly titled `` The Pie Hole . '' A co-worker of Ned 's , Olive Snook ( Kristin Chenoweth ) has a crush on Ned , but Ned rejects her moves , trying not to get close to anyone , learning from past experiences . Private Investigator Emerson Cod ( Chi McBride ) discovered the gift that Ned has , and decides to make him a partner in solving murders . Ned touches the victim , asks who killed them , and when the minute is up , he touches them again , and they solve it . That 's how they usually solve it . Throughout the episodes , the murders have very interesting plots and be what people least expect . One day , Ned discovers that his next murder to solve is his childhood sweetheart , Charlotte `` Chuck '' Charles ( Anna Friel ) . He brings her back to life and decides to break the rules and keep her alive . In her place , the funeral director , who stole jewelery from the corpses , died . When Emerson finds out , and when Chuck wants to help with solving the murders , he does n't agree a bit -- for a while , we hear him call Chuck 'Dead girl ' . This is all kept in secret from Olive , Chuck 's aunts Vivian and Lily ( Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz , respectively ) , and everyone else for that matter , in case anyone recognized her from obituaries , the news , etc . Vivian and Lily , formerly synchronized swimmers , had n't left the house in years . Emerson , Ned , and Chuck agree to work together . Ned and Chuck grow to love each other , though they ca n't touch each other ever again . This show is funny , has terrific characters , contains great plot twists , and will definitely get your spirits up . I hope it does n't get cancelled at 13 episodes ."

188,1,train,"This is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams : Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello . The connection here is the year 1940 . That 's the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of Hal Roach . I 'll mention the significance of the latter later on . Besides being the last time Stan and Ollie worked at the Lot of Fun , it 's also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like Charlie Hall and James Finlayson who appeared in most of their films . It 's also the last time Art Lloyd would serve as their cameraman and Marvin Hatley-who composed their theme song which would be known as `` The Cuckoo Song ( Dance of the Cuckoos ) '' -their score . And it would be the very last time Stan Laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film . If there is a more gag-laden structure than usual in this L & H film , it 's nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny . That includes most of the sound and visual effects , the latter provided by longtime Roach staffer Roy Seawright . In this one , Ollie has `` hornophobia '' from working at a noisy horn factory so Dr. Finlayson prescribes going out to sea for his rest . Ollie does n't like to go boating so Stan suggests they just rent one that 's docked so they would n't have to go anywhere . After they find one they like , we find out that convict Nick Grainger ( Richard Cramer ) has just escaped ... I 'll stop there and say this was as good a finale for L & H 's longtime home as one could hope for . It 's hilarious mostly from beginning to end and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their teaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it . Oh , and I have a couple more lasts to mention : it 's the final film appearance of both Harry Bernard , who plays a harbor patrolman after years of encountering Stan and Ollie as a policeman , and that of Ben Turpin , the cross-eyed comic who was born in New Orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of Baton Rouge , whose second L & H appearance this was having previously `` married '' the boys in Our Wife . The latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment . All right , I mentioned 1940 being the year Stan and Ollie had their last movie released from Hal Roach Studios . It was also the first year that a comedy team , both born in the state of New Jersey , would make their first picture at what would be their home studio , Universal . The director of that movie would be the same one that guided L & H in The Flying Deuces the previous year . His name was A. Edward Sutherland . P.S . It was during this filming that script supervisor Virginia Lucille Jones had an accident involving a rolled-up carpet . That incident caused Oliver `` Babe '' Hardy to send her roses to her hospital room . They fell in love and married on March 7 , 1940 . It lasted until Babe 's death in 1957 ."
189,1,train,"Despite being quite far removed from my expectations , I was thoroughly impressed by Dog Bite Dog . I rented it not knowing much about it , but I essentially expected it to be a martial arts/action film in the standard Hong Kong action tradition , of which I am a devoted fan . I ended up getting something entirely different , which is not at all a bad thing . While the film could be classified as such , and there is definitely some good action and hand to hand combat scenes in the film , it is definitely not the primary focus . Its characters are infinitely more important to the film than its fights , a rather uncommon thing in many Hong Kong action movies . I was really quite surprised by the intricacy of the characters and character relationships in the film . The lead character , played by Edison Chen ( who is really very good ) , becomes infinitely more complex by the end of the film than I ever thought he would be after watching the first thirty minutes . The police characters also defied my expectations thoroughly . In fact , the stark and honest portrayal of the seldom seen dark side of the police force was quite possible my favorite aspect of the film . I do n't know that I would say Dog Bite Dog entirely subverts typical notions of bad criminal , good cop , but it certainly distorts them in ways not often seen in film ( unfortunately ) . So many films , especially Hong Kong action films I find , portray police in what is frankly a VERY ignorantly idealized light . This is one of my least favorite things about the genre . I was pleasantly surprised to see that Dog Bite Dog actually had some very unique , and really quite courageous , ideas to present about the police force . There are negotiation scenes in this film that I have never seen the likes of before , and doubt I will ever see again , and am sure I will remember for quite a while . Also , the criminal characters are shown from an interesting perspective as well , there is some documentary footage in the film of Cambodian boys no older than ten being made to fight each other to the death with their bare hands , which I thought was one of the film 's most powerful and moving moments . It says a lot about the reason these guys are the way they are , rather than simply condemning them . Also , the relationship between Chen 's character and the girl he meets in the junk yard reveals a lot about his character . It was n't until this element entered the film that I really started to see the film as an emotional experience rather than only a visceral one . There is something about most on screen relationships that does n't quite get through to me , but for some reason this one really did . The actress does an incredible job with this role which I imagine was not easy to play . Dog Bite Dog also features some really breathtaking cinematography , all though it is unfortunately rather uneven . There were some moments that I found really striking , particularly in the last segment of the film , but there was also a good deal of camera work that was just OK. Another slight problem I had was with the pacing , which I also felt was uneven . I found a lot of the `` looking for a boat '' scenes to be a little alienating , all though it quickly picks up after that . The action scenes are short and not too plentiful , but are truly powerful and effecting , particularly towards the end . The fight choreography is honestly not all that impressive for the most part , all though to its credit it is solid and fairly realistic , but the true strength is the emotional content behind the fights . The final scene , while not a marvel of martial artistry or fight choreography , is one of the most powerful final fights I have ever seen , and I 've seen quite a few martial arts films . I suppose the biggest determining factor of whether or not one will get much out of Dog Bite Dog is whether or not you can connect with the characters . All of them are certainly some of the more flawed characters one is likely to see in a film of any kind , but there was something very human about all of them that I could n't help but be drawn to and really feel for them , particularly Chen 's girlfriend . I should say that I doubt most people will like the film as much as I did simply because I imagine that most people will not like or care about the characters in the same way , but I still recommend it highly all the same . It is truly a deeply moving and effecting film if you give it a chance ."

Jeff Fahey ( the Ray Liotta look alike ) did a bang up job as the confused , often stammering , police officer that had an affair with Gina . He was stoic as an officer , but he was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extra-marital affair . Steven Weber , most notably from the sitcom `` Wings '' , did a nice job as the quiet , meek , underachieving sociopath .

196,1,val,"Recap : Zandalee is a young woman that feels more and more trapped in her marriage with Thierry . Thierry himself is struggling with the death of his father the previous year and has lost his way . He has submerged himself in work , laid of his writing , and Zandalee desperately misses the attraction between them . Into this enters Johnny , and old friend of Thierry 's who once were artists in exile together . But Johnny has kept on painting , and just have a day job for the rent . He takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow to its destiny . There is an instant raw attraction between Zandalee and Johnny , and they enter into an affair . But Zandalee struggles with her lust to be desired and her conscience and love for her husband . But none of them , not Zandalee , not Johnny and not Thierry can stop the relationships between them to spin totally out of control . Comments : It is set as a thriller . But maybe more a thriller of heart than a normal thriller where it 's about life and death , and threat of violence . Not that a thriller of heart ca n't take on fatal proportions , but the threat comes from a different angle . And it is not really until the second half in Zandalee until the thriller emerges , and even though the foundation for it is laid in the first half , I ca n't really describe the genre as a thriller then . Much more of a romantic drama than anything else , but with the underlying currents of other genres . The developing thriller is there , but it also has more than a little tint of a sensual erotic kind . Because that is what it is all about , what drives the characters and therefore the entire story . Desire . The need to have , and the need to be . In my opinion it is quite good , definitely a lot better than its current ( 4.1 ) rating anyway . It takes its time but it grows a good feeling of suspense , and it handles the erotic part very well , with taste . It is always an integral part of the story , needed to be there to give the story it 's needed weight , and I never felt it was an excuse to show a naked breast or anything like that . But unfortunately the climax of the story comes well before the end , and the end itself feels kind of flat , even if in its own way kind of dramatic . The cast is impressive , spearheaded by known actors like Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold . But the show is almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson . Beautiful and very adept at acting out the sometimes subtle feelings of desire , she excels were both Cage and Reinhold sometimes goes a bot overboard and become a little rough . Her career afterward is too thin for the talent she shows in Zandalee , I can only hope it is because of her own choices . Also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the movie , it is Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano . When you 're in the right mood this is a very good movie , it could have used another end to get the credit it really deserves . 7/10"
197,1,train,"Well , I must say that this was one hell of a fun movie . Despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy , and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason , I was not disappointed . The story was actually pretty interesting : the last member of the Poison Clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil , and who is using them for good . The catch being that during training , all of the clan were masked , and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names . The fights are a joy to watch , as each member of the Poison Clan has a different fighting style : toad ( my favorite ) , snake , scorpion , lizard , and centipede . The fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place , and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action . The one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence . But stick with it , and you wo n't be disappointed !"
